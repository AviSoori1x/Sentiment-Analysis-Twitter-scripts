0,"ROME (AP) — Fiat Chrysler Automobile announced Saturday that CEO Sergio Marchionne's health had suddenly deteriorated following surgery and that its board of directors had chosen Jeep executive Mike Manley to replace him. Marchionne, a 66-year-old Italian-Canadian, joined Fiat in 2004 and led the Turin-based company's merger with bankrupt U.S. carmaker Chrysler. Manley, 54, had been heading the Jeep brand since June 2009 and the Ram brand from October 2015. The announcement, at the end of an urgently convened board meeting, marked the end of the Marchionne era, which included the turnaround of failing Fiat, the takeover of bankrupt U.S. automaker Chrysler and the spinoffs of the heavy machinery and truck maker CNH and supercar maker Ferrari. Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that due to his deteriorating health Marchionne ""will be unable to return to work."" Marchionne, 66, had already announced he would step down in early 2019, so the board's decision, to be confirmed at an upcoming shareholders' meeting, will ""accelerate"" the CEO transition process, the statement said. The England-born Manley had been one of Marchionne's closest collaborators at the group, and in a previous role had been responsible for product planning and all sales activities outside of North America. Marchionne was reported to have had surgery for a shoulder problem about three weeks ago in Switzerland. Fiat is considered a close-knit family, and FCA chairman John Elkann said he was ""profoundly saddened to learn of Sergio's state of health. It was a situation that was unthinkable until a few hours ago, and one that leaves us all with a sense of injustice."" Elkann didn't give details of Marchionne's health problems, adding that his ""first thoughts go to Sergio and his family."" He asked everyone to respect Marchionne's ""privacy and that of all those who are dear to him."" Elkann is a grandson of the late Gianni Agnelli, the longtime Fiat dynasty chieftain. The boards of Ferrari and CNH Industrial, which makes heavy machinery and trucks were called urgently to meet on Saturday in Turin, Fiat's headquarters. Ferrari announced that Louis Camilleri, an Egyptian-board Maltese and longtime executive at Philip Morris International, the tobacco company, was chosen to be replace Marchionne as CEO of the sports car maker. Known for sleeping only briefly each night, Marchionne, who is also a lawyer, was holding multiple leadership roles in the companies, notably as CEO of FCA — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, as well as CEO and chairman of Ferrrari. ___ Milan-based AP business writer Colleen Barry contributed.",65,81,Auto CEO,1
69,"ROME (AP) — The boards of Fiat Chrysler, Ferrari and CNH Industrial have been called to meet in Italy in light of CEO Sergio Marchionne's surgery. The three boards were summoned to separate meetings in Turin on Saturday amid the prolonged convalescence of Marchionne, who had shoulder surgery three weeks ago in Switzerland. Marchionne, 66, has long said he would step down in 2019 as CEO of the FCA automobile manufacturer. Statements from the boards were expected later on Saturday. The Italian-Canadian Marchionne has said his successor as CEO would come from within Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. CEO of Fiat since 2004, Marchionne is also chairman of Ferrari, the luxury sports car brand. During his tenure, Marchionne oversaw Fiat's merger with bankrupt U.S. carmaker Chrysler.

FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said in a statement Thursday that the move would allow the Italian-American automotive company to focus on its core business while giving the components business ""the operational flexibility"" necessary for growth in the coming years. Under the spin-off, shares will be distributed to FCA investors. The separation is expected to be completed by early 2019, with shares of Magneti Marelli listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.

111,"DETROIT (AP) — Fiat Chrysler is moving production of heavy-duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan and paying bonuses to U.S. workers in response to the passage of U.S. tax reform late last year.

139,"MILAN (AP) — Shares in sportscar Ferrari tanked Wednesday after the new CEO told analysts that an annual revenue target set by the late former chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, was ""aspirational."" Louis Camilleri, who is also chairman at long-time Ferrari sponsor Philip Morris International, had a difficult inaugural analyst call. Shares dropped 8 percent on his comments, from 113 euros to 104 euros ($121.30) in the last 20 minutes of Milan trading despite strong quarterly results. Asked about Marchionne's target to reach 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in revenue by 2022, which will be filled out in detail in a business plan presentation next month, Camilleri said the goals had been reviewed by the board and ""were aspirational."" ""Clearly, there were plans behind them. In the capital markets day we will cross the T's and dot the I's, and tell you how we think we will get there. But we will have to disclose potential risk to that and also significant opportunities that we see going forward,"" said Camilleri. Camilleri later sought to clarify his comments, saying he did not mean that the targets were too ambitious, adding that the plans will be outlined in greater detail at the investor day. Ferrari stock has been the hardest hit of the companies Marchionne led since he was replaced on July 21 due to serious complications from surgery. He was also replaced as CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and CNH Industrial chairman. Marchionne, 66, died four days later. The new business plan is expected to outline Ferrari's decision to start making SUVs. Marchionne also had discussed repositioning the brand as a luxury goods company beyond cars. Earlier, Ferrari confirmed its 2018 earnings forecasts after posting an 18-percent rise in net income for the three months through June, to 160 million euros ($187 million). Sales of 12-cylinder models boosted volumes by 5 percent to 2,436 vehicles. Europe and North America led with 7-percent increases, while sales growth in greater China more than offset a decrease in the rest of Asia. Ferrari confirmed its 2018 outlook for shipments of more than 9,000 units with operating profit above 1.1 billion euros on more than 3.4 billion euros in revenues. Camilleri, 63, has been on the Ferrari board since 2015 and is chairman at Philip Morris International. He was Philip Morris chairman and CEO from 2008 to 2013. Camilleri told analysts that he and Marchionne ""shared ambitions for the company,"" but that the two had different management styles and that he would be focused entirely on Ferrari, while Marchionne was deeply engaged in two other companies. The new CEO said one of his chief tasks will be to protect Ferrari's considerable brand equity. ""I think my record as CEO speaks for itself in terms of my ability to manage complex and highly regulated industries,"" Camilleri said. ""I think I am a team builder. And Sergio had a lot of other things on his plate. I have a singular focus on Ferrari and will be her permanently. I think that will make a difference.""",160,176,Auto CEO,6

HOME SALES US existing-home sales fell 0.6 percent in June WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. sales of existing homes fell 0.6 percent in June, the third straight monthly decline as higher prices and a relative lack of inventory has sidelined many would-be buyers. The National Association of Realtors says homes sold last month at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.38 million in May. Over the past year, home sales have tumbled 2.2 percent. Many Americans searching for homes face prices that are climbing at roughly double the pace of wages. Sales of entry-level homes worth less than $250,000 have fallen amid a constrained inventory. Still, the number of homes for sale rose in June on annualized basis for the first time since the middle of 2015. The median sales price in June increased 5.2 percent from a year ago to $276,900. ITALY-FIAT CHRYSLER Fiat Chrysler is shaken without visionary CEO behind wheel MILAN (AP) — Fiat Chrysler shares have been volatile today as investors express worry about the exit of ailing CEO Sergio Marchionne, whose driven and creative management style has been the company's fortune. Shares in the Italian-American carmaker closed down 1.5 percent after a harder 4 percent opening tumble in the first trading since Marchionne's grave health condition was disclosed over the weekend. Trading was volatile, especially after news that the head of the big European operations, who had been considered one of Marchionne's potential successors, was quitting. Ferrari, where Marchionne was also replaced at the helm, closed down about 5 percent. The Fiat Chrysler board on Saturday named long-time Jeep executive Mike Manley as CEO, unexpectedly accelerating a transition that was planned for early next year. The company said the 66-year-old Marchionne suffered complications from shoulder surgery in Zurich, Switzerland last month that worsened in recent days, and that he could not resume his duties. TESLA-STOCK Tesla stock skids on report it asked suppliers for refunds NEW YORK (AP) — Shares of Tesla tumbled today on reports that the company asked suppliers for refunds to help it turn a profit. A memo provided to The Wall Street Journal shows the electric car maker asked a supplier to return what it calls a meaningful amount of money on its payments since 2016. The memo said all suppliers were being asked to help the company become profitable. Tesla declined to comment on the specific memo, but confirmed that it is seeking price reductions from suppliers for projects, some of which date back that far. The request raised more questions about Tesla's cash position. The 15-year-old company has reported only two quarterly profits and has never made a profit for a full year. It is spending about $1 billion a quarter as it ramps up manufacturing of the Model 3 sedan and had $2.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. INDIA-IRAN OIL SANCTIONS India cuts oil imports from Iran by a quarter in past year NEW DELHI (AP) — Facing the threat of U.S. oil sanctions on Iran, India continued to rely on Iraq as its top oil supplier in the April-June quarter, followed by Iran and Saudi Arabia. India's petroleum minister says the country bought 7.27 million metric tons of oil from Iraq, 5.67 million tons from Iran and 5.22 million tons from Saudi Arabia during the three-month period. India's state-run refineries bought 9.8 million tons of Iranian oil in financial 2017-18 compared to 13.04 million tons a year earlier, a nearly 25 percent decline. India's financial year runs from April to March. India imported 29.66 million tons of Iraqi oil in 2017-18 compared to 24.79 tons a year earlier. The petroleum minister didn't say what steps India is taking in response to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which are to come into force on Nov. 4. PAPA JOHN'S-POISON PILL Papa John's attempts to ward off founder with poison pill LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Papa John's is attempting to ward off its disgraced founder by adopting a poison-pill plan. Founder John Schnatter (SHNAH'-tur) resigned as chairman this month after his use of a racial slur during a media training session was revealed. He stepped down late last year as CEO after becoming enmeshed in the national anthem issue involving players, saying it was hurting sales. Schnatter, who later said his resignation was a mistake, is still the pizza chain's biggest shareholder, holding just short of 30 percent of all stock. The company, based in Louisville, Kentucky, said late Sunday it will put its shareholder rights plan in place for a year. The plan would be activated if anyone acquires 15 percent or more of the company's outstanding shares without board approval. DAILY NEWS-LAYOFFS NY Daily News slashes newsroom staffing in half NEW YORK (AP) — The New York tabloid Daily News will cut half of its newsroom staff, saying it wants to focus more on digital news.

In an email sent to staff today, tronc said staff at the Daily News will focus on breaking news involving ""crime, civil justice and public responsibility."" Revenue and print circulation have been sliding at the newspaper for years, even as it provided critical coverage of health issues in public housing and for first responders after the Sept. 11 attacks.

LIFEPOINT HEALTH-BUYOUT Apollo to spend $5.6B on rural hospital chain LifePoint UNDATED (AP) — Private equity firm Apollo Global Management will spend about $5.6 billion to buy the rural hospital chain LifePoint and combine it with health system operator RCCH HealthCare Partners.

The combined, privately held company will operate under the LifePoint name and be led by the hospital chain's chairman and CEO, William F. Carpenter III. It will run 84 hospitals in 30 states as well as physician practices, outpatient centers and regional health systems. It also will be based in Brentwood, Tennessee, where both firms are currently based. The deal still needs approval from LifePoint shareholders and regulators.

279,"DETROIT (AP) — Fiat Chrysler's Jeep brand is giving the Cherokee compact SUV a major face-lift so it can better compete in one of the hottest parts of the U.S. automotive market. The 2019 Cherokee, unveiled Tuesday at the Detroit auto show, gets styling tweaks, a new engine, suspension improvements and engineering changes that save 200 pounds and improve gas mileage over the current model. At an impromptu news conference after the SUV was revealed, CEO Sergio Marchionne hinted at three future new products and said he'll be pushing for higher Jeep sales growth in Europe. The updated Cherokee gets a new 2-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine with 270 horsepower and technology that shuts it down at stoplights to save fuel. It's similar to the engine in Alfa Romeo sports cars. A 3.2-liter V6 and 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine carry over from the current model. A polymer tailgate is among the changes that help save 200 pounds. Jeep also redesigned the rear cargo area, adding 4 cubic feet of storage space by making it wider so golf clubs can fit in straight rather than at an angle. All this is to better compete with new versions from the competition such as the Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox. When the latest-generation Cherokee came out in 2013, its curvy front grille departed from the normal flat Jeep front-end with round headlamps. That angered some Jeep purists who love the old look. Jeep took a step toward the old front-end, giving the 2019 model a larger grille, combining LED headlamps and daytime running lights and adding a new hood and fender design. ""We polarized the market. We split it in half. People either loved it or they hated it. I think when you look at the rest of the range, that's much more in line with what Jeep is offering,"" Marchionne said. The Cherokee appeals mostly to suburban drivers who seldom go off the road, yet Marchionne said it's still capable of doing so. ""You always have the right to do that. The right to go off the road and do stuff to me is worth anything,"" he said. Fiat Chrysler wouldn't give the exact on-sale date for the revised Cherokee, to be built in Belvidere, Illinois. The company says it will release fuel mileage and pricing later. Also at the event, Marchionne said new SUVs are coming and called the Jeep brand's growth in Europe ""shameful:"" — The company's Alfa Romeo performance brand will add a three-row large SUV by 2022. It will be larger than the Stelvio, Alfa's first SUV. Fiat Chrysler also has developed an SUV based on the Pacifica minivan underpinnings but hasn't decided whether to produce it. Once a decision is made, it could come in 18 to 20 months. A new Jeep Wrangler pickup truck will debut early in 2019, after Marchionne retires. The Ferrari brand also is developing an SUV that likely will go on the market around the start of 2020, he said. — Marchionne said he is ""really ticked off"" about Jeep's relatively slow growth in Europe. He has replaced the brand's leader there and will embark on a campaign to grow sales. ""We need to get the machine started. It's the laggard in the system. It's the one that should be doing a lot better than it really is doing because the market is up and we're just not getting our share."" For the first 11 months of 2017 Jeep sales rose 2.6 percent to 96,077 over the same period in 2016. That left market share in the European Union unchanged at 0.7 percent even though the overall market grew 4.1 percent, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.",457,473,Auto CEO,9
299,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Donald Trump instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives Friday. The president met with top auto executives to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs. A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months. Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards. The EPA under Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025. The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard. If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. Any big change by Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states. In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard. ""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina. As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily. Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens."" ""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable."" Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales. Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump. Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said. Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars.

452,"MILAN (AP) — Fiat Chrysler shares were volatile Monday as investors expressed worry about the exit of ailing CEO Sergio Marchionne, whose driven and creative management style has been the company's fortune. Shares in the Italian-American carmaker closed down 1.5 percent after a harder 4 percent opening tumble in the first trading since Marchionne's grave health condition was disclosed over the weekend. Trading was volatile, particularly after news that the head of the company's big European operations, who had been considered one of Marchionne's potential successors, was quitting. Ferrari, where Marchionne was also replaced at the helm, closed down about 5 percent. The Fiat Chrysler board on Saturday named long-time Jeep executive Mike Manley as CEO, unexpectedly accelerating a transition that was planned for early next year. The company said the 66-year-old Marchionne suffered complications from shoulder surgery in Zurich, Switzerland, last month that worsened in recent days, and that he could not resume his duties. No other details were released. Marchionne will be a hard act to follow. Analysts credit his industry vision and ability to strike deals and take risks for increasing the market value of Fiat by tenfold since he took over in 2004. And while he was due to retire in 2019, most expected him to stay on in some role to guide the company. ""Some of us assumed he'd remain as chairman and be there to phone in his instructions,"" Max Warburton, an analyst at market research firm Bernstein who often publicly tussled with Marchionne on conference calls about the company's earnings. ""Marchionne ran FCA in a command and control style, with constant firefighting measures. There is no operating manual to follow,"" he said. Marchionne engineered both the turnarounds of Italian carmaker Fiat and Chrysler, which Fiat acquired in 2009 in a deal with the U.S. government, creating the world's seventh-largest carmaker out of two formerly dysfunctional entities. He created shareholder value for the Fiat-founding Agnelli family with successful spinoffs of Fiat's heavy vehicle maker CNH Industrial and of the iconic Ferrari super sports car company. But his goal of another big merger failed to find any takers. Marchionne proved himself a consummate deal-maker. He won control of Chrysler in a 2009 deal with U.S. President Barack Obama's government without putting a penny down, only in exchange for bringing more small-car technology to Chrysler. In May of 2011, less than two years after leaving bankruptcy, Marchionne pulled off a huge refinancing of the company's $7.5 billion loan from the U.S. government, retiring it with a combination of corporate bonds, loans and payments, even though Chrysler had not yet turned an annual profit. Some of the debt carried at 12 percent interest rate and cost the company $1.2 billion in interest per year. The maneuver helped the company to start making money again. The Italian Canadian manager later demonstrated his agility by refocusing U.S. production on trucks and SUVS and away from passenger cars to meet market demand, a process that got underway in 2016. And when President Donald Trump took office, Marchionne quickly responded to his calls to keep jobs in America by repatriating production at a Mexican plant. On Monday, Trump called Elkann to inquire about Marchionne's condition, the company confirmed. In Italy, Marchionne moved production away from low-margin small cars and toward pricier Alfa Romeo and Maserati models for the export market, even if his relaunch of Alfa still has not reached his targets. Manley's first appointment in the role was at a regular Fiat Chrysler executive council meeting in Turin on Monday, and his first public appearance will be to present FCA's second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Marchionne had announced in his last major presentation to analysts last month that the quarterly results would show Fiat Chrysler at zero debt for the first time — an occasion for which the normally casually attired Italian-Canadian manager donned a tie — even if only briefly. The five-year plan included a significant shift to electrified motors. Manley, 54, has been key to transforming the quintessentially American Jeep brand into a global marquee since taking over there in 2009, and he also has been the head of the Ram truck division since 2015. Tokyo-based auto analyst for Nomura Securities, Anindya Das, called Manley ""a natural choice"" to replace Marchionne as ""Manley has been heading FCA's main profit and growth engine Jeep since 2009."" Both brands have formed the leading edge of Fiat Chrysler's North American strategy to move away from passenger car production and focus on SUVs and trucks to meet market demand. ""Although Mr. Manley's public profile has been relatively low and limited to operational matters, he was heavily involved in setting the 2019-22 strategic plan,"" Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jeffries Financial Services, said in a note. ""We expect continuity."" But he also expressed concern that Fiat Chrysler's success has been linked to Marchionne's ability to shift strategy to meet targets. ____ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed from Detroit.",113,129,Auto CEO,13

""He was a great leader of not just Formula 1 and the automobile world, but the business world overall. ""He led with great passion, energy and insight, and inspired all around him.

693,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Donald Trump has instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives. The president met with top auto executives Friday to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs. A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months. Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards. The EPA under Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025. The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard. If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. Any big change by Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states. In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard. ""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina. As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily. Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens."" ""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable."" Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales. Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump. Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said. Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars.

Global equity markets settled after some turmoil earlier in the week sparked by a news report that China might slow or halt purchases of U.S. Treasurys, which Beijing later challenged. Treasury yields dipped, easing fears of a bear market for bonds. Investors are now looking ahead to the latest quarterly corporate earnings reports and consumer price inflation report later during the U.S. trading day. China's trade growth cooled in December in a sign of weaker global and domestic demand. Major U.S. benchmarks ended with solid gains yesterday. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to a record 2,767.56.

CHINA-NORTH KOREA-TRADE China's December trade with North Korea falls 50 percent BEIJING (AP) — China reports its trade with North Korean shrank 50 percent in December from a year earlier as governments tightened sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development. The Chinese customs agency said Friday that imports from the North shrank 81.6 percent to $54 million while exports to the isolated, impoverished country contracted 23.4 percent to $260 million. The U.N. Security Council has steadily tightened prohibitions on buying the North's goods or supplying it with oil in an effort to discourage leader Kim Jong Un's government from pursuing nuclear and missile technology. CHINA-AUTO SALES China auto sales shrink in December, end year up 1.4 percent BEIJING (AP) — An industry group says China's auto sales shrank in December and ended 2017 up just 1.4 percent over the previous year as the popularity of SUVs helped to offset contraction in demand for sedans. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Friday said last month's sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans shrank by 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.6 million. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses edged up 0.1 percent to just over 3 million. Weakness in Chinese demand is a setback for global automakers that look to China to drive future revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing companies to pour resources into developing electric vehicles.

INDIA-ROCKET LAUNCH India launches rocket carrying dozens of satellites NEW DELHI (AP) — India launched a rocket carrying dozens of satellites from India and six other countries Friday from its island space center. A. S. Kiran Kumar, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, said the satellites successfully reached orbit after the polar satellite launch vehicle took off from Sriharikota, an island off Andhra Pradesh state in the country's southeast.. Apart from two Indian weather satellites, the rocket carried 28 micro and nano-satellites from Canada, Finland, France, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. The lift-off was postponed by a minute because of fear of collision with space debris, the New Delhi Television news channel said. The last launch of India's first privately built satellite failed in August because of a heat shield problem. Friday's launch is the latest in a string of successes for the Indian space agency. Last June, India launched its heaviest-ever rocket it hopes will eventually be able to carry astronauts into space, a feat only Russia, the United States and China have achieved.

Employers added 233,000 jobs in May, up from 159,000 in April, the Labor Department reported Friday. ___ Trump's teasing jobs report tweet raises questions WASHINGTON (AP) — With a tantalizing tweet, President Donald Trump seemed to tease a positive jobs report on Friday. The protocol-defying step moved markets and raised questions about the appropriateness of the president publicly hinting at information that could make or lose fortunes. Treasury yields jumped and the value of the dollar increased within seconds of Trump's 7:21 a.m. tweet. This suggests that traders likely were making investment decisions based on what they extrapolated from Trump's post. ___ From distillers to farmers, trade war would cause casualties WASHINGTON (AP) — If a trade war is coming, the cheese makers of Wisconsin are standing in the line of fire. So are the farmers of the Great Plains and the distillers of Kentucky. And the employees of iconic American brands like Harley Davidson and Levi Strauss. The likelihood of a trade conflagration suddenly leapt closer to reality after the United States imposed tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. ___ Department stores making themselves over in beauty battle NEW YORK (AP) — It's the beauty aisles themselves getting makeovers now. Department stores are being forced to rethink how they sell higher-end makeup and perfume as competition intensifies from discounters like Target, specialty chains like Sephora and Ulta and online brands. So stores like Saks and Macy's are promising workouts for your face, augmented reality and beauty treatment concierges as they try to attract millennial customers and make the cosmetics aisles more of a destination than a stopover. ___ Ex-chemical industry lawyer to lead Superfund task force WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer tapped to lead a task force at the Environmental Protection Agency overseeing cleanups at the nation's most polluted places worked until recently for a top chemical and plastics manufacturer potentially responsible for creating some of those toxic sites.

(AP) — Applebee's is suing a Kansas City area franchise owner over the closure of a restaurant where two black women said they were falsely accused of not paying for meals in an earlier visit. The Kansas City Star reports that the chain claimed ""significant brand and reputational damage"" from the ""controversial and high-profile circumstances of the closure"" of the restaurant at the Independence Center Mall. It happened in February after the two women posted a video showing an employee, a police officer and a mall security guard confronting them for ""dining and dashing"" during a previous visit, which the women denied. The Kansas City area franchise holder also closed six other restaurants. The lawsuit says Applebee's didn't approve any of the closures. It's seeking $11 million in total damages. POSTAL-SERVICE-FINANCES Postal Service: More financial loss as mail delivery slumps WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Postal Service is reporting another quarterly loss. That's because strong gains in package deliveries were outweighed by an unrelenting decline in mail volume and the costs of its health care and pension obligations. The financial report released Friday comes amid sharp criticism from President Donald Trump, who says the Postal Service is being scammed out of billions by Amazon and other online retailers. The Postal Service is seeking greater freedom to raise stamp prices to help cover costs. It warns of a weak financial situation that demands attention to allow for much-needed investments in package delivery in the e-commerce age. The Postal Service report shows a net loss of $1.3 billion between January and March, larger than a $562 million loss in the same period last year.

936,"MILAN (AP) — Carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported Thursday a 60 percent rise in net profit for the first quarter of the year as sales improved, particularly in the Americas, and demand rose globally for its Jeeps. The company said its profit of 1.02 billion euros ($1.24 billion) was up from 641 million euros in the same quarter a year earlier, though net revenue edged down 2 percent to 27.03 billion euros. Fiat Chrysler maintained its guidance for full-year earnings, saying it still expects net revenue of about 125 billion euros. It shipped 1.2 million vehicles in the first quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier. The boost was mainly due to improved sales in North and Latin America as well as a 37 percent rise in shipments at its Jeep unit. One of Fiat Chrysler's goals has been to reduce its net debt and end 2018 with 4 billion euros in cash. CEO Sergio Marchionne, who traditionally wears black sweaters, has vowed to wear a tie at a big strategy presentation on June 1 if the company manages to become cash positive.

Chairman John Elkann, heir to the Agnelli family that founded Italian carmaker Fiat in 1899, called Marchionne a ""true, rare kind of leader ... (whose) impulse never to accept the status quo, never to be satisfied with good enough, has become a core part of our culture within FCA.""

1068,"MILAN (AP) — Fiat Chrysler's late founding CEO Sergio Marchionne was a notorious workaholic who regularly slept on a corporate jet while landing in the headlines for his shrewd deal-making. Despite his very public profile, he kept a secret even from his board: he'd been seriously ill for more than a year. Following his sudden death last week at 66, the revelation that Marchionne had kept his illness from his company and closest executives for so long has rekindled a debate over what information top executives should share about their personal life with their companies and shareholders. Most experts believe CEOs have a right to privacy, especially where their health is concerned. But some say that coming forward would help break taboos on workplace illness for other executives and workers. Top executives also need to take into account their role as a corporate officer when weighing what personal information they divulge — first to their boards, then to their workers and the wider investing community. ""I think it is classic stuff really. When you are a senior person, to be ill, there is a stigma to it,"" said Cary Cooper, an expert in organizational psychology and health at the Manchester Business School in Britain. ""In this case, he might have thought it would adversely affect the company, or that he wouldn't be allowed to carry on."" Cooper noted that the CEO of Lloyd's Bank, Antonio Horta-Osorio, had disclosed his struggle with depression, helping to open up a discussion about mental health. At the same time, many captains of industry are not willing to show their physical limits and see illness as just another obstacle to overcome. ""The kind of people who get to the top are pretty resilient people, and they think they are going to overcome it anyway,"" Cooper said. Marchionne's case was unique because he was singularly identified with the automaker he created from two failing companies. Financial analysts, considering his plans to step down in the spring of 2019, had already expressed concern about whether any successor would be able to demonstrate his level of creativity and flexibility, most recently when Marchionne last month laid out the carmaker's five-year plan. Jason Schloetzer, a business administration professor at Georgetown University, said he does not believe CEOs are under any legal obligation to disclose their health issues. But he added: ""It would be nice for there to be an internal process through which not just the CEO, but any key member of the operating team can feel comfortable sharing personal issues that may be a risk factor to company performance."" While the FCA board acted swiftly to replace Marchionne as CEO on July 21 after being told by his family that he could not return to work due to complications after shoulder surgery, the Swiss hospital where he died Wednesday later disclosed that he had been receiving cutting-edge treatment there for a serious illness for more than a year. Fiat Chrysler reacted to the disclosure with a statement saying the company had been unaware of the longer-standing state of Marchionne's health, having only been informed of the shoulder surgery last month. In the week from news of Marchionne's illness to his death, Fiat Chrysler shed nearly 11 percent on the Milan Stock Exchange amid volatile trading. The stock lost 9 percent in the same period the New York Stock Exchange. As far as Italy's market regulator, Consob, is concerned, the FCA board acted properly by replacing Marchionne as soon as it had word. He was also replaced that day as CEO of Ferrari and as chairman of CNH Industrial. Peter Henning, a former lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said SEC action is unlikely, as there's no clear rule about what a company is supposed to disclose about a CEO's health. ""It's an interesting question, about where do you draw the line between public disclosure and an individual's privacy? And the SEC has not weighed in on this, unless there is a misleading disclosure. Otherwise, the SEC is going to defer to the company,"" Henning said. At the same time, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of Management, said CEOs have ""a moral, ethical and legal responsibility ... as an officer of the company to consider the material adverse consequences of this very important information. As an officer, you surrender some degree of privacy."" Sonnenfeld said that includes not only disclosing who you do business and meet with but also health issues. He said it's up to corporate boards to have rules in place about health disclosures. He cited JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein — both of whom informed their boards and employees of their cancer diagnosis, continuing full duties after treatment — as two good models. Apple, on the other hand, knew about Steve Jobs' illness ""but put out misinformation"" when the founding CEO failed to show up at MacWorld in 2008, Sonnenfeld said. ""That was worse than spins. It was falsehoods,"" he said. Doug Chia, executive director of the governance center at the Confidence Board think tank, said the lesson from the Marchionne case is that boards need to think about having ""some kind of procedure where there is some periodic checkup on the CEO's health, or some kind of advanced agreement that the CEO will let them know about medical information."" Giuseppe Berta, who has written books about Fiat and Fiat Chrysler and who knew Marchionne, expressed surprise that heir to the Fiat-founding Agnelli family, FCA Chairman John Elkann, had not known about Marchionne's illness. ""Evidently, the ties between Marchionne the manager and John Elkann the shareholder were by now very deteriorated,"" Berta said. ""Under normal circumstances, something of this sort would emerge."" While Marchionne had put Fiat Chrysler on a strong financial footing, having eliminated debt as long promised, Berta said hewing to that goal also meant that the carmaker did not make the investments in new products that competitors did, including for electric cars and looking ahead to greater automotive connectivity and autonomous driving. Berta speculated it was Marchionne's desire to put the company on firmer ground to meet the goals in the 5-year-plan he laid out on June 1 that led him to hide his illness. Such gestures, however, are useless hubris, experts say. ""Nobody — and I mean nobody — is indispensable,"" Cooper said. ""Everyone said 'What is going to happen to Apple after Steve Jobs?' Has it done badly?"" ____ AP Automotive Writer Tom Krisher contributed from Detroit.",47,63,Auto CEO,29

1164,"DETROIT (AP) — The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opened to the press this week with one big question hanging in the air: How will autonomous vehicles change the industry? The answer is still unclear. In the meantime, automakers continue to put out new vehicles of all shapes and sizes, including small cars, SUVs and the all-mighty pickup truck, which dominated the show. All will be on display when the show opens to the public Saturday, with a charity preview on Friday night. Here are five things we learned from the preview this week: TRUCKS ARE KING Pickups are the most popular vehicles in the U.S., and trucks unveiled at the show make clear that will continue for a long time. General Motors spent heavily to update its top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup, cutting up to 450 pounds of weight by using more aluminum and lighter high-strength steel. The truck also gets two new V8 engines that can run on one to eight cylinders depending on how much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler's Ram also got big updates, losing more than 200 pounds and giving it a gas-electric hybrid engine option. Both the Silverado and Ram were given more athletic stances and meaner looks. Ford added a diesel engine to its F-150 and rolled out the midsize Ranger. Automakers turn big profits on large pickups. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. Ford's F-Series is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the Silverado and Ram. TAX REFORM BOOST? U.S. auto sales are likely to fall to around 16.7 million in 2018 from 17.2 million last year, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. But that would still make it one of the 10 best sales years in history, so the market remains strong. U.S. income tax code changes this year may stimulate new auto sales, but any increase likely will be offset by rising interest rates and the abundant supply of late-model used cars that pull buyers from new vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp.'s top North American executive says. North American CEO Jim Lentz expects a sales boost of 200,000 vehicles as tax cuts put more money in people's pockets. But the increase could be negated as rising rates keep some people on the sidelines, and some buyers opt for a lower-cost but nice off-lease used car. Tax cuts could boost pickup truck sales because businesses can write off the expenses immediately under the new code, Lentz said. But he expects luxury new-car sales to be flat this year even though tax rates were reduced for higher-income earners. Any decrease could be wiped out by caps on deductions for mortgage interest and local and state taxes in big luxury-car states such as New York and California, Lentz said. TRADE DEAL Many auto executives interviewed at the auto show say they're afraid the U.S. might pull out of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, but they can't prepare for it because they don't know what, if anything will replace it. In ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada, the Trump administration is seeking to ensure that more vehicles are made in America, among other changes. But Jim Lentz, Toyota's North American CEO, says ending the agreement would likely raise costs. That, in turn, would raise vehicle prices and cut demand, forcing manufacturing layoffs. It also would make the U.S. less competitive than the world's other manufacturing centers, he said. Ending the agreement also could force some suppliers to stop making parts. Charlie Chesbrough, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, said it's hard to imagine there will be much change in production, because automakers need a long lead time to act and they know the next president could reverse Trump's actions. But some automakers are already taking pre-emptive steps to show the administration they're willing to boost U.S. production. Fiat Chrysler said ahead of the auto show that it will move heavy duty truck production from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. HEDGING ON ROBOT CARS Automakers are hedging their bets when it comes to autonomous vehicles and whether they will someday cut into or even end personal car ownership. In interviews through the week, executives said they're preparing for a time when people hire self-driving ride services to get around instead of spending on personal vehicles. But they don't know just when that will take place, so they also must continue to spend millions to develop conventional vehicles as well. ""These proclamations that we hear about the advent of electrification and artificial intelligence ... are all things that, at best, are conjecture,"" said Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Although some companies plan to deploy driverless cars to carry passengers in coming months, Marchionne says it will take years for the vehicles to be in widespread use. Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development says he wishes he knew exactly when and where the switch would take place. But for now, GM and other companies have to be in both places. ""We can go either way and that agility is priceless,"" said Reuss. GOOD OLD DAYS Despite the new wheels on the show floor, one of the biggest hits is a 50-year-old Mustang GT fastback in need of a paint job. It was one of the original cars used in the 1968 film ""Bullitt,"" which put the Mustang on the map with a famous chase scene. Ford Motor Co. rolled it out to help celebrate a special ""Bullitt"" edition Mustang, which goes on sale this summer.

""He was a great leader of not just Formula 1 and the automobile world, but the business world overall. ""He led with great passion, energy and insight, and inspired all around him. His contributions to Formula 1 are immeasurable. He was also a true friend to all of us and he will be deeply missed. At this difficult time we extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends and colleagues."" Marchionne, who was Italian and Canadian, replaced Luca di Montezemolo at the head of Ferrari in 2014 — with the famous Italian scuderia a fading force in the sport. Ferrari was the most successful team in F1 but won the last of its 16 constructors' titles in 2008. Under Marchionne's leadership, Ferrari returned to title-contending form. It has won four of the 11 races to date in 2018 and is challenging for both the drivers' and constructors' titles. Sebastian Vettel finished runner-up to Lewis Hamilton last year and is currently second, 18 points behind the Mercedes driver. ""This is a sad day for all of us in F1. We have a lost a huge supporter of our sport, a fierce competitor, an ally and a friend,"" said Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff.

1376,"MILAN (AP) — Sergio Marchionne, the founding CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles who died Wednesday, was widely recognized as an industry leader. Here's a look at some of his biggest accomplishments. ___ CREATING VALUE Since taking over Fiat in 2004, Marchionne has increased the company's market value more than tenfold. Fiat's share price rose from 1.4 euros ($1.64) to as much as 20 euros ($23.4) this year. That increase reflects the takeover of Chrysler but also the spinoff of key units, like Ferrari. ___ GETTING CASH FROM GM The move that made Marchionne's name as a dealmaker was getting General Motors to pay $2 billion in 2005 to sever ties with Fiat. The two companies had had a legal contract by which Fiat could have forced GM to buy out the company. GM was afraid of taking on Fiat's debt. So Marchionne convinced it to pay the divorce fee instead — money that helped Fiat get back on its feet. ___ BUYING CHRYSLER FOR NOTHING In 2009, as CEO of Fiat, Marchionne struck an agreement to take over Chrysler without putting down a penny. In exchange, it offered its small-car technology, which Chrysler had been lacking. That saved Chrysler from liquidation and since then it has become the profit-leader in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. ___ SPINOFFS Marchionne unlocked wealth by spinning off subsidiaries, above all the sports car and racing unit Ferrari and the construction vehicles manufacturer CNH. Ferrari is now worth 27 billion euros ($32 billion) and CNH about 18 billion euros ($21 billion).",13,29,Auto CEO,34
1387,"MILAN (AP) — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' new CEO sought Wednesday to reassure investors about the future without the late founding chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, as the latest earnings report showed a drop in profits and lower full-year targets. Mike Manley made his debut to the financial community shortly after news of the death of the 66-year-old Marchionne, whose planned exit next year had been accelerated over the weekend by a sudden deterioration in health. The 54-year-old Briton, who worked alongside Marchionne for nine years leading the turnaround of the Jeep unit, opened a call with analysts with a minute of silence for what he called ""a special, unique man."" Manley discouraged any speculation that Fiat Chrysler would be looking for any tie-ups in the post-Marchionne era. Instead, he said it would focus on the five-year business plan that Marchionne had laid out just weeks ago. ""I think we are in a position now we can deliver our five-year business plan as an independent, strong organization,"" Manley said, not ruling out specific cooperation with other carmakers. Still, Manley began his tenure by announcing that earnings targets would be lowered — something that Marchionne had been loath to do and which saw the share price tumble over 15 percent. Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said Marchionne would have made the same decision, based on the second-quarter numbers, while conceding that any meetings with Marchionne on the topic ""were always very colorful."" Despite a record quarter in North America, Fiat Chrysler reported a 35-percent drop in second-quarter profits to 754 million euros ($881 million) from 1.15 billion euros a year earlier. It cited problems in China, including import duties that hurt sales of its luxury Maserati nameplate, increased competition from domestic brands, and lower shipments from the Chinese joint venture. As a result, the Italian-American company lowered its full-year target for earnings before interest and tax to a range between 7.5 billion euros and 8 billion euros, from 8.7 billion euros previously. It dropped its net revenue target to a range between 115 billion euros and 118 billion euros, from 125 billion euros. The guidance for adjusted net profits remained at 5 billion euros. Manley noted that Marchionne had presaged last month that the quarter would be tough. ""It has proven to be just that,"" he said. Investors responded by pushing the share price down 15.5 percent by the end of trading. The carmaker also ended the quarter cash-positive for the first time, eliminating debt — as Marchionne had announced in June — and with net industrial cash of 456 million euros. North America continued its role as profit-driver, generating 85 percent of the company's 1.65 billion earnings before interest and taxes. The performance was driven by higher volumes of the new Jeep Wrangler, Cherokee and Compass as well as Dodge Journey, as the company continued to reap the benefits of the shift to SUVs and away from passenger cars. The Asia region swung to a loss of 98 million euros while Maserati profits were nearly wiped out, dropping to 2 million euros from 153 million euros a year earlier. European earnings sank 6 percent, to 188 million euros, largely due to lower net pricing. Latin America turned in 6 percent of the automaker's profits, with a nearly 70 percent increase in earnings, to 101 million euros. Overall, Fiat Chrysler reported a 6 percent increase in shipments to 1.3 million, boosting revenue by 4 percent to 29 billion euros ($34 billion).",147,163,Auto CEO,35

1479,"MILAN (AP) — Automaker Fiat Chrysler raised its profit-sharing with U.S. employees after reporting Thursday that profits nearly doubled last year, thanks to higher margins on its model mix that helped overcome a sales decline in North America. Outgoing Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told analysts that the company would hit zero debt in 2018, as set out in the business plan laid out four years ago. Fiat issued full-year 2018 guidance of net revenues above 125 billion euros and an adjusted net profit of around 5 billion euros. ""As management, we fell relatively good about the fact we haven't missed a year since the plan was launched, and we have maintained upgraded guidance notwithstanding the fact that we lost Ferrari from the mix,"" when it was spun off two years ago, Marchionne said. The CEO is set to step aside next year, but not before laying down one more business plan on June 1. While he won't be in charge to execute it, Marchionne told analysts that his successor would come from his top tier of managers. ""My successor is coming from those ranks. You don't have to go outside and look in other industries. We are not going into fashion or aircraft making,"" Marchionne said. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported net profit for last year hit 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion), compared with 1.8 billion a year earlier, as the company cut its industrial debt nearly in half to 2.4 billion euros. Marchionne said he expected to hit zero debt in the second quarter. More than 70 percent of 2017 profits were generated in North America, where Marchionne has shifted production away from cars, with more than two-thirds of all production now in trucks and utility vehicles. As a result, Fiat Chrysler announced it would increase profit-sharing to 40,000 union workers on an hourly wage in the United States to $5,500 each — up from $5,000 last year. That will be in addition to a $2,000 bonus already announced for 60,000 hourly and salaried workers due to savings from the Trump administration's tax plan. Marchionne said he would maintain present guidance until the third quarter before considering a boost as has been customary at the house, despite the positive benefits of the U.S. tax plan. Marchionne said ""there is a strong likelihood"" Fiat Chrysler, long the No. 3 among the big three U.S. carmakers, would outperform Ford in profits this year. The carmaker delivered 4.7 million vehicles globally, in line with the previous year. U.S. sales fell 8 percent to 2.1 million vehicles due to a decline in fleet sales to the lowest level since 2001. The company has been making efforts to reduce fleet sales in favor of high-profit generators, and declines were partially offset by sales of Ram trucks, the premium Alfa Romeo brand and Jeep brand SUVs. Profit margins in the region rose to 8 percent from 7.1 percent. Full-year profits also rose in Latin America, Asia and Europe. Net revenues for the year were nearly 111 billion euros, shy of the revenue target of 115 million euros to 120 million euros. Adjusted net profit of 3.7 billion euros exceeded guidance of above 3 billion euros. Fiat shares rose 0.5 percent in Milan, trading to 19.54 euros Thursday.

1554,"BALOCCO, Italy (AP) — Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne is outlining his business plan for the automaker's next five years in his last big presentation to investors before retiring next year. The presentation Friday of the 2018-2022 business plan marks Marchionne's grand finale, 14 years to the day after he was named Fiat CEO. During that time he has merged Fiat with U.S. carmaker Chrysler and spun off the industrial vehicle business and sports carmaker Ferrari. Markets will be watching for Fiat's plans in Italy, where Marchionne has focused production on the premium Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands; the United States, where Fiat Chrysler has led the strategy of dumping passenger cars for higher-margin trucks and crossovers; and China. Marchionne has said a successor would come from within the company.",40,56,Auto CEO,3
1560,"The nomination of Mike Manley as CEO of Fiat Chrysler marks a turning point for the carmaker, putting a brand with historic Italian roots in the hands of someone with no ties to Italy — a Brit who showed his mettle by growing the quintessentially American Jeep into a global brand. Manley has been one of the closest collaborators with the company's longtime leader Sergio Marchionne and had been seen as a possible successor since Marchionne announced in January that he planned to step down next year. Those plans were pushed up Saturday after Marchionne's health deteriorated following surgery. The 54-year-old Manley also headed the Ram truck brand, which together with Jeep have been the focus of Fiat Chrysler's growth strategy in North America, whose market represents two-thirds of Fiat Chrysler's earnings. ""The success of the Jeep brand under Mike Manley and his global background make him the smart choice to be the new head of FCA,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. ""His international experience in growing that brand will play a key role as he applies those techniques to all of the Fiat Chrysler divisions."" Manley had joined the company in 2000. He took over management of the Jeep brand in 2009, just after Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy protection funded by the U.S. government. At the time, the all-SUV Jeep mainly was a U.S. brand, where sales languished at around 232,000 for the year. By 2017, though, sales had nearly quadrupled to more than 828,000 as Americans snapped up all-wheel-drive SUVs. The brand also grew internationally, especially in China, under Manley, and has a difficult goal of hitting 2 million in sales worldwide this year. Manley stayed at the company through tumultuous times when other executives were ousted, and his roles were expanded because he performed, said Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs. ""He's low-key and the opposite of Sergio,"" she said. ""He just went about his business."" Krebs attended Fiat Chrysler's five-year business plan unveiling in Italy earlier this year. ""A large part of it was the Mike Manley show,"" Krebs said. ""My sense is he helped develop the plan."" Krebs doesn't see any major changes in the way FCA is run under Manley, but says the company does face challenges as the U.S. auto market cools down a bit after record sales. The company also will have to deal with possible tariffs imposed on vehicles and parts both by the U.S. and in retaliation from other countries. Fiat Chrysler exports Jeeps and other vehicles from the U.S., and it also imports some of its models from Italy and Mexico, especially the growing Alfa Romeo sport luxury brand, she said. Manley has a master's degree in business administration from Ashridge Management College. He was born in Edenbridge, Great Britain.",366,382,Auto CEO,40
1578,"MILAN (AP) — Fiat Chrysler's second-quarter earnings presentation was meant to celebrate long-time CEO Sergio Marchionne's achievement of eliminating all debt for the formerly troubled company. Instead, it will be overshadowed by his early and sudden exit for serious health problems and the debut of his replacement, Mike Manley. Credited with the turnaround of the Jeep subsidiary, Manley faces his first big test as the group CEO on Wednesday, when he lays out the Italian-American automaker's earnings and takes questions from analysts likely to focus on how he will manage hard-earned growth and profitability. Max Warburton, an analyst at research firm Bernstein, said the 54-year-old British manager's outing would be ""a difficult baptism."" The financial community, he noted, had assumed Marchionne would keep a hand in the business, perhaps as chairman ""to phone in his instructions."" The uncertainty created by Marchionne's sudden exit was evident in volatility in the share price Monday, when the stock opened sharply lower only to recover. By Tuesday, its losses were fully recouped. Manley then got a vote of confidence from ratings agency Standard & Poors, which said Fiat Chrysler's BB+ credit grade and positive outlook remained unchanged by the change in CEO. For the stock, Warburton said ""2019 should be a solid year. ..... But long-term concerns will build."" He noted Marchionne had close control of all aspects of the company, so it's unclear how the leadership change might affect that. Fiat Chrysler's second-quarter net income is expected to come in at 1.28 billion euros, which would be an 11 percent increase over the same period last year, according to a survey of analysts by financial data company FactSet. Sales are expected to have risen 3 percent to 28.87 billion euros. And it will be Manley who will confirm the achievement of zero debt, announced last month by Marchionne. Marchionne remains hospitalized in Zurich, Switzerland, after his health deteriorated suddenly due to undisclosed complications from surgery on his right shoulder. No details have been disclosed, but Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann has made clear that his condition precludes a return. Manley's experience in the United States, where Fiat makes three-quarters of its profits, was key to his nomination. While Marchionne was the most public face of Fiat Chrysler for the last 14 years, with trusted executives operating mostly behind the scenes, Manley played a key role in both drafting and presenting a new five-year business plan that foresees Jeep and Ram, the two brands he ran, as the growth-drivers. The plan calls for 9 billion euros in investments as the carmaker tries to catch up in the market for gas-electric hybrids and fully electric vehicles. ""Mike Manley has extremely strong credentials to run a global automaker in technological and strategic transition,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. He noted Jeep's global expansion, four-fold jump in sales volumes and the doubling of its product lineup since Manley took over in 2009. Manley's biggest challenges will be to continue Marchionne's efforts to find industrial partners — which the former CEO repeatedly said was needed to bring down costs — and to expand into new technologies, like automation, Jonas said.  Manley will also oversee the planned spin-off of components business Magneti Marelli, announced earlier this month. Jonas noted that Marchionne continually dismissed concerns that his involvement in all strategy would hamper succession, referring to ""the deep bench of talented leader he had groomed over the years."" ""Investors must decide if the next generation can carry the legacy,"" Jonas said.",103,119,Auto CEO,41

1729,"DETROIT (AP) — The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opened to the press this week with one big question hanging in the air: How will autonomous vehicles change the industry? The answer is still unclear. In the meantime, automakers continue to put out new vehicles of all shapes and sizes, including small cars, SUVs and the all-mighty pickup truck, which dominated the show. All will be on display when the show opens to the public Saturday, with a charity preview on Friday night. Here are five things we learned from the preview this week: TRUCKS ARE KING Pickups are the most popular vehicles in the U.S., and trucks unveiled at the show make clear that will continue for a long time. General Motors spent heavily to update its top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup, cutting up to 450 pounds of weight by using more aluminum and lighter high-strength steel. The truck also gets two new V8 engines that can run on one to eight cylinders depending on how much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler's Ram also got big updates, losing more than 200 pounds and giving it a gas-electric hybrid engine option. Both the Silverado and Ram were given more athletic stances and meaner looks. Ford added a diesel engine to its F-150 and rolled out the midsize Ranger. Automakers turn big profits on large pickups. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. Ford's F-Series is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the Silverado and Ram. TAX REFORM BOOST? U.S. auto sales are likely to fall to around 16.7 million in 2018 from 17.2 million last year, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. But that would still make it one of the 10 best sales years in history, so the market remains strong. U.S. income tax code changes this year may stimulate new auto sales, but any increase likely will be offset by rising interest rates and the abundant supply of late-model used cars that pull buyers from new vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp.'s top North American executive says. North American CEO Jim Lentz expects a sales boost of 200,000 vehicles as tax cuts put more money in people's pockets. But the increase could be negated as rising rates keep some people on the sidelines, and some buyers opt for a lower-cost but nice off-lease used car. Tax cuts could boost pickup truck sales because businesses can write off the expenses immediately under the new code, Lentz said. But he expects luxury new-car sales to be flat this year even though tax rates were reduced for higher-income earners. Any decrease could be wiped out by caps on deductions for mortgage interest and local and state taxes in big luxury-car states such as New York and California, Lentz said. TRADE DEAL Many auto executives interviewed at the auto show say they're afraid the U.S. might pull out of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, but they can't prepare for it because they don't know what, if anything will replace it. In ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada, the Trump administration is seeking to ensure that more vehicles are made in America, among other changes. But Jim Lentz, Toyota's North American CEO, says ending the agreement would likely raise costs. That, in turn, would raise vehicle prices and cut demand, forcing manufacturing layoffs. It also would make the U.S. less competitive than the world's other manufacturing centers, he said. Ending the agreement also could force some suppliers to stop making parts. Charlie Chesbrough, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, said it's hard to imagine there will be much change in production, because automakers need a long lead time to act and they know the next president could reverse Trump's actions. But some automakers are already taking pre-emptive steps to show the administration they're willing to boost U.S. production. Fiat Chrysler said ahead of the auto show that it will move heavy duty truck production from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. HEDGING ON ROBOT CARS Automakers are hedging their bets when it comes to autonomous vehicles and whether they will someday cut into or even end personal car ownership. In interviews through the week, executives said they're preparing for a time when people hire self-driving ride services to get around instead of spending on personal vehicles. But they don't know just when that will take place, so they also must continue to spend millions to develop conventional vehicles as well. ""These proclamations that we hear about the advent of electrification and artificial intelligence ... are all things that, at best, are conjecture,"" said Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Although some companies plan to deploy driverless cars to carry passengers in coming months, Marchionne says it will take years for the vehicles to be in widespread use. Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development says he wishes he knew exactly when and where the switch would take place. But for now, GM and other companies have to be in both places. ""We can go either way and that agility is priceless,"" said Reuss. GOOD OLD DAYS Despite the new wheels on the show floor, one of the biggest hits is a 50-year-old Mustang GT fastback in need of a paint job. It was one of the original cars used in the 1968 film ""Bullitt,"" which put the Mustang on the map with a famous chase scene. Ford Motor Co. rolled it out to help celebrate a special ""Bullitt"" edition Mustang, which goes on sale this summer. The faded green car got a huge cheer when it rumbled onto the stage.",4687,4703,Auto CEO,32

45,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is gearing up to lead a buyout of the electric car maker in a stunning move that would end the maverick company's eight-year history trading on the stock market. In his typically unorthodox fashion, the eccentric Musk dropped his bombshell on his Twitter account, which he has used as a platform for pranks, vitriol and now for a proposal to pull off one of the biggest buyouts in U.S. history. Musk got the ball rolling Tuesday after the stock market had already been open more than three hours with a announcing he had secured funding to buy all of Tesla's stock at $420 per share with no further details. At that price, the buyout would cost nearly $72 billion, based on Tesla's outstanding stock as of July 27, but it's unlikely the deal would cost that much because Musk owns a roughly 20 percent stake in the Palo Alto, California, company. He also said he intends to give Tesla's existing shareholders the option of retaining a stake in the company through a special fund, if they want. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk wrote in his first tweet, following up with ""good morning"" and a smiley emoji. He later that the only uncertainty about completing the deal is whether he can gain shareholder approval. The first tweet came hours after the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had built a significant stake in Tesla Inc., but it was unclear if that was the funding Musk was referring to. The Financial Times, citing unnamed people with direct knowledge of the matter said Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund had built a stake of between 3 and 5 percent of Telsa's shares. Musk's announcement was initially met with widespread skepticism, with many people connecting the proposed price to 420 being a common slang term for marijuana. Musk also previously used his Twitter account to joke that Tesla was going bankrupt in an April Fool's Day and his stability was called into question last month after he called a British diver who helped rescue children from a Thailand cave a pedophile. That baseless tweet was quickly deleted and Musk apologized to the diver. The confusion caused by Musk's Tuesday announcement via Twitter also prompted regulators of the Nasdaq stock market to temporarily suspend trading in Tesla's stock. Although it's unusual for a CEO to make such a major announcement over social media, it does not appear to be improper. ""It's very unusual for any CEO other than Elon Musk. This is not how you do it and it makes you wonder how seriously to take it,"" said Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan. Musk probably wasn't violating any regulations by simply announcing that he was considering taking the company private, Gordon said, but his assertion that the funding already has been locked up could ""expose him to at least potential legal risk"" if it turns out that the financing is on shaky footing. Musk later brought some clarity to the situation in an email to Tesla employees that was on Tesla's blog. Trading in Tesla's stock resumed shortly after the letter's release, and the stock climbed 11 percent to close at $379.57. Musk's offer is 9 percent higher than Tesla's peak closing price of $385 reached nearly a year ago. By taking Tesla private, Musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring from one quarter to the next. Making money has proven elusive for Tesla while it has been investing in electric car technology and ramping up production of its vehicles, including a sedan with a starting price of $35,000 to appeal to a broader audience. The company has only posted a quarterly profit twice in its history and has never made money during an entire calendar year, something that Musk has been trying to change by cutting costs, including recent mass layoffs that trimmed Tesla's workforce by 9 percent. Tesla lost another $717.5 million in its most recent quarter. Musk ""has been running Tesla like a private company with publicly traded stock anyway so this deal makes some sense,"" Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey said. Tesla completed an initial public offering of stock in 2010, largely because Wall Street provided a convenient vehicle to raise billions of dollars to finance its expansion. By going private, Tesla will lose that convenient source of financing, something that could cause massive headaches if the company continues to burn through cash as much as it has in recent years, Ramsey said. Despite its challenges, Tesla has remained a favorite among many investors, partly because of their faith in Musk, who made his initial fortune as a co-founder of PayPal and also is the CEO of a trail-blazing aerospace company, SpaceX, that's already private. But another substantial segment of investors are convinced Tesla is doomed to fail and are betting on the company's eventual demise by becoming ""short sellers"" of its stock. Short sellers borrow shares from other investors and then immediately sell them on the premise that they will be able to buy them back at a lower price later to replace they stock they borrowed. Musk has long raged against short sellers and mentioned his desire to be rid of them as one of his reasons for taking Tesla private. ""Being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company,"" he wrote. If Musk decides against going private, Gordon said his credibility could take another hit, though one he could weather. ""If he doesn't go forward with it, it will end up be another Elon Musk big mouth faux pas,"" Gordon said. ""He will live to see another day. People will shake their heads and say, 'that's Elon.'"" ____ Alexandra Olson reported from New York.",31,39,Auto CEO,47

133,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai under an agreement signed Tuesday, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that suggested the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production.",911,919,Auto CEO,51

Flash forward more than two years, through much-publicized production delays. Reynolds is still waiting. And now, like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide, he worries that the looming phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach. ""The tax credit was going to be huge,"" says Reynolds, 45, who works in digital advertising, lives in Laguna Hills, California, and drives a 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car. Last week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 — the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out. Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year. Then it drops to $3,750 for six months and $1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31, 2019. That means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $7,500 tax break — essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model's sticker price. Many Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out, predicted Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., an auto research and consulting firm. ""By then they will have been waiting for three years possibly,"" he said. Tesla wouldn't comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list. But if buyers bail, it could put the company's future in peril, costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history. Tesla is using the Model 3 to move from a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses. CEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year, but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company. In the first three months of this year it burned $1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont, California, factory. The company had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of March. In March, Moody's Investor Service sounded an alarm, downgrading Tesla's debt into junk territory and warning that it won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and drive profits. Musk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June. Like many of those still on the waiting list, Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $35,000 base. The cheapest version only comes in black, with other colors costing at least $1,000 more. At present, Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer-range battery packs. The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla's website, the lowest price was $49,000, beyond what he can afford. He wants the car badly enough that he'll spend over $40,000, as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $35,000. He'll hang on until the end of this year. Beyond that, he said he'll likely drop out if there's no federal credit and ""if no configuration options are made for the frugal, penny-pinchers like myself."" Others on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit. Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns. Most Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit — about 120,000 — are wealthier people who didn't need it to buy Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X, which can cost over $100,000, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid. He said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility. ""If you can afford to buy a $140,000 Tesla, you don't really need the incentive,"" he said. The only other automaker that's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors, which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April of 2016 because she believes in Musk's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero. Three months ago, she canceled her order, partly because of the delays, partly because she now wants a hatchback. Lindland also wondered if she'd ever get the car. ""I've already been on the list for two years,"" she said. ""I need all-wheel-drive, and I would have to wait another year."" She doesn't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week, and she is skeptical of the cars' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money, unable to service vehicles. Christian Kingery, a Seattle-area web developer, was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016. He wanted a loaded version with all-wheel-drive for rainy weather, but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits. He compromised and ordered a rear-drive version in April. But his delivery date was delayed, costing him the Washington credit, which he says was worth $3,000 before it expired in May. When all-wheel-drive became available, he switched his order, pushing delivery to September. Although Kingery is frustrated, he still wants the car.  ""Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing, in a way that no other carmaker is doing,"" he said. Like Reynolds and Lindland, he knows about the Model 3's impressive handling, 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen. He will just have to wait a little longer to drive one.",2012,2020,Auto CEO,52

271,SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Wall Street Journal is reporting that government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors. The Journal cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Fox Business News was the first to report the SEC's action. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with an August 7 tweet revealing that he lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell. The subpoena signals regulators have now opened a formal investigation into whether Musk was telling the truth in his tweet.,135,143,Auto CEO,55
293,"MUNICH (AP) — Charging an electric car away from home can be an exercise in uncertainty — hunting for that one lonely station at the back of a rest-area parking lot and hoping it's working. In Europe, some of the biggest automakers are out to remove such anxieties from the battery-only driving experience and encourage electric-vehicle sales by building a highway network of fast charging stations. The idea is to let drivers plug in, charge in minutes instead of hours, and speed off on their way — from Norway to southern Italy and Portugal to Poland. Much is at stake for the automakers, which include Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Ford. Their joint venture, Munich-based Ionity, is pushing to roll out its network in time to service the next generation of battery-only cars coming on the market starting next year. They're aiming to win back some of the market share for electric luxury car sales lost to Tesla, which has its own, proprietary fast-charging network. Despite a slower-than-expected start, Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch told The Associated Press in an interview he's ""confident"" the company will reach its goal of 400 ultra-fast charging stations averaging six charging places each by 2020. The idea is ""to be able to drive long distances with battery electric vehicles, across Europe and to have the same experience at each station, meaning a very easy and comfortable customer journey,"" Hajesch said, speaking at  the company's Munich headquarters near the 1972 Olympic stadium. The idea is to break electric cars out of the early adopter niche, in which they are charged slowly overnight at home and used for short commutes. ""The sites we are looking for are really the A-sites,"" he said, ""directly at the autobahn. Not down the road, not driving five kilometers into the next industrial area and finding a charging station somewhere, without light, or any amenities around, but right at the autobahn."" ""If you're going from Hamburg to Munich, because it's a weekend trip to friends, typically you do not have much time,"" he said. So what counts will be ""the speed of recharging your vehicles, and at the same time finding maybe some amenities: maybe a coffee, getting a newspaper or whatever."" Ionity opened its first station April 17 at a rest stop off the A61 highway near the small town of Niederzissen,  50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Bonn in western Germany. The six high-speed chargers are operating in ""welcome mode,"" meaning they're free until May 31. After that, Ionity plans to charge for the power, which it seeks to obtain from renewable sources. Ionity has agreements for some 300 sites, working with fueling station and rest stop landlords. The average distance between stations will be 120 kilometers (75 miles). More charging availability is what it will take to get an environmentally aware car buyer like Rainer Hoedt to choose a battery-only vehicle. The 58-year-old Berlin geography teacher is a proud owner of a Mitsubishi Outlander, a plug-in hybrid that combines internal combustion with a battery he can charge overnight. The battery-only range of 50 kilometers (30 miles) lets him drive emissions free for daily trips at home. But a family vacation of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the Baltic Sea was a different story. Hoedt had to drive on internal combustion before finding a lone charging station as he approached his destination, using the goingelectric.de website. ""It was right next to the highway, there was one charging station and we were lucky that it was free,"" he said. But he couldn't find a charging station he could use by the seashore. On the way back, he was able to charge at a rest stop, but only by asking a non-electric car owner to move his vehicle away from the lone charging pole. A battery-only car might never have made it home. And he couldn't use one to visit his cousin 650 kilometers (400 miles) away in Rosenheim. ""I looked at the option... The infrastructure is still so bad, I just don't want to risk that I get stranded,"" he said. ""Once the infrastructure gets better, that might be my next car."" Tesla has shown how charging infrastructure can drive vehicle sales. It has 1,229 stations with 9,623 fast chargers in Europe alone, where it has cut into Mercedes and BMW's sales of luxury cars. But it has its own proprietary plug. Ionity is using the CCS plug backed by the European Union as a common standard for all. In both the U.S. and Europe, the situation is roughly similar:  More chargers available in jurisdictions where government strongly backs electric vehicles, such as California, Norway or the Netherlands. Elsewhere, chargers get can harder to find for long stretches along rural highways. Volkswagen, which agreed to invest in low-emission driving to settle charges it cheated on diesel emissions, is building 300 highway charging sites in the U.S. by June 2019 through its Electrify America unit. Japan has 40,000 charging points, exceeding its 34,000 gas stations, according to Nissan — but many of those are private garages. Ionity is counting on the large 350-kilowatt capacity of its publicly available chargers — almost three times the 120 kilowatts per vehicle of Tesla's Superchargers. No car currently on the market can make full use of 350 kilowatt charging capacity. But they're coming: in 2019 Porsche plans to introduce the Mission E. Porsche says that the sleek, low-slung sports car will take 15 minutes to charge for 400 kilometers (250 miles) more driving. Tesla and its founder, Elon Musk, ""showed it's not enough to just build electric cars"" without also building charging infrastructure, said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the CAR Center Automotive Research at the University of Duisberg-Essen. The automakers ""are late, but it's better than it was... it remains the case that without Elon Musk the carmakers would not have realized this,"" he said.",5505,5513,Auto CEO,56

453,"DETROIT (AP) — A wireless update of antilock braking software improved the stopping distance of Tesla's electric Model 3, prompting Consumer Reports to reverse course and give the car its ""Recommended Buy"" rating. The magazine said Wednesday that the update cut 19 feet off the car's stopping distance from 60 miles per hour.  A previous test — the results of which were released a little more than a week ago — found that it took 152 feet for the Model S compact car to stop from 60, the longest braking distance of any modern car the magazine has tested. The improved braking raised the car's score high enough for it to receive the coveted recommendation. But Consumer Reports still has concerns over wind noise, a stiff ride, and the touch-screen controls that could distract a driver. After the first round of testing was made public, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to fix the problem within days. Consumer Reports says it was told by Tesla that the software helps the brakes adapt to variations in how they are used and how they respond in different environmental conditions. On Twitter Wednesday, Musk wrote that he appreciates the ""high-quality critical feedback"" from Consumer Reports and said that noise and ride comfort already had been addressed. Another software update will address the controls, he wrote, without elaborating. Musk told the magazine last week that Tesla had already made production changes to address wind noise, the harsh ride and an uncomfortable rear seat, Consumer Reports said in a statement. Consumer Reports said it will rent another Model 3 from Tesla to check on the changes and will report back on the results. The magazine bought a Model 3 for the first test and said it doesn't normally rent test vehicles. The Model 3 is Tesla's first attempt to appeal to mass-market buyers. The car that starts at $35,000 but can run as high as $78,000 has been plagued by production delays. Tesla's software update was done either via the car's cellular connection or a wireless internet link, depending on how the owner configures the car, according to Tesla. Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, said that in 19 years of work for the magazine he has not seen a car's track performance improve with a wireless update. Musk pledged in a tweet last week that the braking improvements would make the Model 3 best in its class. But Consumer Reports said the stopping distance was not class leading and the further updates may be necessary. The magazine also said nearly all of the Model 3's controls are on a center touch screen direction with no gauges on the dashboard and few buttons inside the car. This forces drivers to take several steps to do simple tasks and can cause driver distraction, the magazine said. Consumer Reports also said it got a record 350 miles of range per charge with a long-range version of the Model 3 when it's set on a high mode to recharge batteries with energy from braking.",850,858,Auto CEO,58
454,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. increased production of its Model 3 mass-market car in the first quarter but still fell far short of the numbers it promised last summer. The Palo Alto, California, company says it made just under 9,800 Model 3s from January through March. That's four times what it made in the fourth quarter. But it's still only a fraction of the 20,000 per month that CEO Elon Musk promised when Tesla first started making the car. The news, released just before the markets opened Tuesday, pushed Tesla's shares up about 3 percent to $259.54 in early trading. Still, they have fallen nearly 15 percent since the start of the year on a string of bad news for the 15-year-old company. Tesla says it made just under 35,000 vehicles total in the quarter including the Models S and X. That's a 40 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. The company predicted that Model 3 production will climb rapidly through the second quarter and reach about 5,000 vehicles per week around early June. Tesla predicted high sales volume, good gross profit margins and strong cash flow. ""As a result Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,"" the company said in a regulatory filing. The Model 3, with a starting price of around $35,000, is the car that's most important to Tesla's future. It's the company's first lower-cost, high-volume car and is crucial to its goal of becoming a profitable, mainstream automaker. Tesla at one point had more than 500,000 potential buyers on the waiting list for the Model 3. But in a statement Tuesday, the company conceded that some had canceled, refusing to give numbers. Tesla said Model 3 reservations ""remained stable"" through the first quarter. The cancelations, it said, were ""almost entirely due to delays in production in general and delays in availability of certain planned options,"" including dual motor all-wheel-drive versions and a smaller battery pack. Tesla said it doubled the weekly production rate of the Model 3 last quarter by addressing production and parts supply bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment. The company said it delivered 29,980 vehicles during the quarter. The increased production comes after a succession of bad news for the company this year, which started with low production numbers in the fourth quarter when the company made only 2,425 Model 3s. Then, two federal agencies opened investigations into crashes of two of its models on California freeways, including one that killed a man near Mountain View. In the Mountain View-area crash, Tesla said last weekend that the Model X SUV was operating on the company's semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" system when it hit a freeway barrier.

638,"DETROIT (AP) — A former employee hacked into computers at Tesla's Nevada battery factory, stole confidential information and combined it with falsehoods in leaks to the media, the electric car maker alleged in a federal lawsuit. The suit was filed Wednesday, three days after CEO Elon Musk warned employees of sabotage from within the company. Martin Tripp of Sparks, Nevada, admitted to Tesla investigators that he wrote software that transferred several gigabytes of data outside the company, including dozens of photographs and a video, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday. Hacking software from Tripp also was running on three computer systems of other employees ""so that the data would be exported even after he left the company and so that those individuals would be falsely implicated,"" the lawsuit alleged. A man who answered a call Wednesday at a number believed to be Tripp's said he did not know Tripp. An email message was not answered. Tripp made false claims about the information he stole, including claims that Tesla used punctured battery cells in the Model 3 electric car, and claims about the amount and value of scrap material generated by Tesla in the manufacturing process, the lawsuit alleged. Some of the claims made it into media stories about the company, but media organizations are not identified in the lawsuit. The company also alleges that Tripp sent photographs and data to unspecified third parties including financial information and battery manufacturing details. Data was combined with false information given to the media, the lawsuit said. The company says Tesla's name was damaged and the company lost business and profits due to the disclosures. On Sunday night, Musk emailed employees telling them of ""extensive and damaging sabotage"" to the company's manufacturing operating system done under false user names. He wrote that the person's motivation was that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. Musk wrote that there's a long list of organizations that ""want Tesla to die,"" including Wall Street stock short-sellers and oil and gas companies. The company was investigating whether the former employee acted alone, Musk wrote. Tesla wants monetary damages and an order to prevent Tripp from obtaining or disclosing information. It also seeks a court order to inspect his computers, electronic storage devices, email accounts and external storage accounts. Tesla would not comment on the lawsuit Wednesday. It was unclear if the company reported the alleged thefts to law enforcement. Sparks police Officer Ken Gallop said there was no record of an investigation involving Martin Tripp. Storey County Sheriff Gerald Antinoro did not immediately respond to email and telephone messages from The Associated Press. Sandra Breault, spokeswoman for the FBI in Nevada, said she was checking into the matter. Tripp joined the company in October of 2017 at the battery factory as a process technician, and had electronically signed a non-disclosure agreement, the lawsuit said.  Within a few months of his hiring, managers identified problems with his job performance, including at times being disruptive and combative with colleagues, according to the document. He was reassigned on May 17, 2018, and retaliated against the company by stealing the information, the lawsuit alleged. ____ Associated Press Writer Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York City contributed.",280,288,Auto CEO,60

When questioned on the Model 3 by an analyst, Elon Musk cut him off, calling questions dry and ""not cool."" He then allowed multiple questions from a person via YouTube.

726,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking relief from the pressures of running a publicly held company with a $72 billion buyout of the electric car maker, but he may be acquiring new headaches with his peculiar handling of the proposed deal. Almost everything about the deal is outlandish, from Musk's out-of-the-blue disclosure in a nine-word tweet to the assertion that he has lined up adequate financing to a buy a company that seems to burn through cash faster than it produces cars. If Musk can pull it off, he will have burnished his reputation as an eccentric visionary who has been compared to Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy depicted by actor Robert Downey Jr. in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But if the buyout flops, Musk and Tesla will likely face class-action lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were duped, and potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. The SEC already has opened an inquiry into the wording and method of Musk's disclosure about the deal, according to a Wednesday report in The Wall Street Journal , which cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. ""It's very obvious that Musk did not talk to any lawyers before he made his tweet,"" said John Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor and corporate-governance expert. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The SEC declined to comment. Skepticism about the legitimacy of Musk's proposed deal surfaced almost immediately after Musk dropped the bombshell on his Twitter account a few hours after the stock market opened Tuesday. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk tweeted, without elaboration or any corroboration from the company. It took about two hours before Tesla posted a Musk email to company employees on its website elaborating on his reasons for wanting to do the deal, making it clear he was serious. Before that happened, Tesla's stock had already soared. Trading in Tesla's stock was eventually halted until everyone could figure out what was going on. It wasn't until Wednesday when six directors on Tesla's nine-member board publicly acknowledged that Musk approached them last week about pursuing the financing for a buyout that would take the company off the stock market. Like Musk's tweet and email to employees, the directors' statement didn't contain details on how the buyout would be financed. The murkiness of the financing could turn into a legal mine field for Musk and Tesla, according to both Coffee and former SEC lawyer Pete Henning, now a law professor at Wayne State University. That's because Musk tweeted that the financing for the buyout had been locked up without equivocation. If there is an indication the financing is shaky, it almost certainly will expose the company and its CEO to allegations of market manipulation or fraud, Coffee and Henning said. News of the potential buyout already has stung investors known as ""short sellers"" who have long been a thorn in Musk's side. Short sellers borrow company stock and then resell the shares in the open market in a bet that they will be able to replace them at a much lower price in the near future to repay their debt. Tesla's stock surged 11 percent on Tuesday, collectively costing short sellers more than $1 billion, by some estimates. ""If (Musk's) motive was frustration with short sellers, then that could be a case of market manipulation,"" Coffee said. Those who believe Musk is carrying out a vendetta against short sellers may point to a May 4 tweet suggesting he might have something up his sleeve. ""Oh and uh short burn of the century comin (sic) soon,"" he wrote. Musk's use of Twitter to announce a huge deal also raised eyebrows, but that probably didn't violate any laws, Coffee and Henning said. The SEC has previously ruled that using social media to disclose company news is OK, as along as investors have been told that those channels may be used. Tesla disclosed in a November 2013 regulatory filing that shareholders should follow Musk's Twitter account to keep up with company news. Even though Musk has 22.3 million followers on Twitter, Tesla probably should have ensured even wider distribution of the news by simultaneously posting information on its website and filing documents with the SEC, Coffee and Henning said. Some of the fervor for a Tesla buyout faded Wednesday. Tesla's stock backtracked by more than 2 percent to close at $370.34. One of the biggest questions surrounding the buyout is Tesla's long history of losing money while it has been investing in electric car technology and ramping up production of its vehicles. The Palo Alto, California, company has only posted a quarterly profit twice in its history and has never made money during an entire calendar year, something that Musk has been trying to change by cutting costs, including recent mass layoffs that trimmed Tesla's workforce by 9 percent. Tesla lost another $717.5 million in its most recent quarter. Musk has promised to begin making money on a consistent basis starting in the third quarter, escalating the pressure that he has already publicly acknowledged has taken an immense toll on him. Just last week, he revealed he had been working 110 hours a week to deliver on short-term promises he had made to Wall Street, a load he traced to his boorish behavior toward two analysts earlier this year. ""It's very clear that he doesn't like to deal with being a CEO of a public company,"" said Gene Munster, a former stock market analyst who is now managing partner of investment fund Loup Ventures. ""I am not sure it is beating him down, but I am sure he is sick of it."" By taking Tesla private, Musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring from one quarter to the next. Buying Tesla in its entirety would cost $72 billion, based on the company's outstanding stock as of July 27. But Musk probably doesn't need that much financing because he owns a roughly 20 percent stake in the company and he is also creating a special fund that will allow existing shareholders to retain their stakes in Tesla in the private market, if they want. Munster estimates Musk will need $25 billion to $30 billion to buy out all the Tesla shareholders who want to sell at $420. Tesla also would likely need to borrow billions more to help pay for its ambitious plans of its electric vehicle line and its battery manufacturing plants. In a Wednesday research note, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated Tesla will end up taking on about $50 billion in additional debt if the company goes private. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this story.",31,39,Auto CEO,62
759,"Electric car maker Tesla Inc. burned through $739.5 million in cash last quarter, paving the way to a company record $717.5 million net loss as it cranked out more electric cars. But CEO Elon Musk pledged to post net profits in future quarters, and on a conference call, he apologized to two analysts he cut off on the company's first-quarter call. Telsa's shares jumped 9.3 percent to $328.85 in after-hours trading. The net loss more than doubled from the same quarter a year ago, and was slightly larger than the first quarter. But Tesla's cash burn in the second quarter slowed from about $1.1 billion. On the call, Musk also said he expects the company to avoid returning to the markets for capital and to be ""essentially self-funding on a go-forward basis."" Tesla would use money generated from sales to fund big projects such as an estimated $2 billion new factory in China and another plant in Europe, he said. The company also said that Model 3 gross profit margins turned slightly positive during the quarter as it worked out expensive kinks in its manufacturing system. Last quarter, Musk mistreated two analysts by calling their queries about the company's cash needs and Model 3 orders ""so dry"" and ""not cool.""  The call triggered a stock sell-off and raised questions about Musk's behavior. But on Wednesday, a contrite Musk apologized to both and said he was tired from working more than 110 hours per week last quarter. ""It's not right,"" he told an analyst from RBC Capital Markets. ""Hope you accept my apologies."" In a statement released after the markets closed Wednesday, Tesla said it expects to produce 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s in the third quarter, an increase of at least 75 percent from the first quarter. Tesla spent millions as it reached a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of June. It now says production is rising, with the goal of 6,000 per week by the end of August. The company said it expects to reach 10,000 Model 3s per week ""sometime next year."" Cash from selling the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 but runs far higher with options, is key to holding off more borrowing and turning a profit. Tesla's cash balance fell to $2.2 billion in June, from $2.7 billion in the first quarter. Musk said he expects the company to achieve sustained quarterly net profits from now on, barring an unforeseen event, supplier problems or economic downturn. He also said that production efficiencies should rise as more Model 3s are built, and he said that he expects to make to around 750,000 vehicles in calendar year 2020. The company said it has cut back on capital spending by changing its strategy to produce the Model 3 on existing assembly lines, one in a giant tent, rather than adding all-new lines. Tesla projected total 2018 capital spending at just below $2.5 billion. That's substantially less than the 2017 level of $3.4 billion. The Palo Alto, California, company said it lost $4.22 per share from April through June as revenue grew 43 percent to just over $4 billion. Adjusted for stock-based compensation, the company lost $3.06 per share. That was worse than Wall Street estimates. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a $2.88 loss per share. Tesla also said it's working on a new version of its Autopilot semi-autonomous software that will have greater safety features. During the second quarter, Tesla laid off 9 percent of its workforce as it worked toward Musk's promise of making money.

787,"Elon Musk's erratic behavior was front and center again this week as the CEO of Tesla conceded that he's overwhelmed by job stress, pushing his electric car company's stock down and bringing pressure on its board to take action. Musk's revelation, in a Thursday interview with The New York Times, came as government regulators are reportedly investigating whether his recent out-of-the-blue tweet about taking Tesla private violated disclosure requirements. Now, experts say Tesla has reached an intersection where the board must decide the direction of its leadership. Among their suggestions: Remove Musk as CEO, permanently or via a temporary leave of absence, or appoint a No. 2 executive who could act as a steadying hand. ""It's kind of bizarre,"" said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. ""It's a drama we shouldn't be watching."" Tesla presents plenty of challenges for the top executive: It routinely loses money and is burning through cash as it ramps up development of its Model 3 sedan, a less-expensive electric car it hopes appeals to the mass market. A large number of investors known as short-sellers have bet against the company. Musk has added to those pressures with lofty projections for profits and production that Tesla often fails live up to. Plus, the eccentric billionaire is the head of at least two other companies, including the rocket company Space X. Musk admitted to the Times that the past year has been the most ""difficult and painful"" of his career. The newspaper reported that during an hour-long telephone interview on Thursday, an emotional Musk acknowledged that he was working up to 120 hours a week and sometimes takes Ambien to get to sleep. Yet he said he has no plans to give up his dual role as Tesla's chairman and CEO. ""If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now,"" he told the paper. Tesla's board showed no sign of taking action on Friday. In a statement to The Associated Press, directors praised Musk's leadership, saying he had put hundreds of thousands of popular cars on the road, created tens of thousands of jobs and created significant returns for shareholders. Musk was not involved in crafting the statement. Shares of Tesla Inc. tumbled about 9 percent, closing Friday at $305.50, their lowest level since Aug. 1. For the week, the company shares lost 14 percent, or $8.5 billion in market value. Recent developments put board members in a difficult position because Musk, who entered Tesla as a major investor and built the company into a force that has changed the perception of electric cars, is the company's public identity. But Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business and law professor, said the board has a duty to shareholders. ""If the board does not get him out of this slot at a minimum on a leave of absence basis, I think the board is going to be seen by a lot of people who love the company as being derelict in their duties,"" Gordon said Friday. The board has stood behind Musk despite some bizarre behavior. For instance, in a recent tweet he labeled a diver who aided in the cave rescue of Thai soccer players as a pedophile. He later apologized. But a tweet Musk said he fired off on Aug. 7 while driving to the airport may force the board to act. In it, Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. Investors pushed Tesla's shares up 11 percent in a day, boosting its value by $6 billion. There are multiple reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the disclosure, including asking board members what they knew about Musk's plans. Experts say regulators likely are investigating if Musk was truthful in the tweet about having the financing set for the deal. Musk told the Times he stands by the tweet. At a normal company, Musk, 47, would have been replaced already, Elson said. But Tesla isn't quite normal. Elson said most of the company's directors have relationships with Musk, who owns about 20 percent of the company. ""At some point the board is going to have to assert its authority,"" Elson said. ""They're at a point where they're going to have to distance their oversight from any prior relations."" But even if Tesla's board wanted to remove Musk as CEO, it would be dangerous to do it abruptly given how much faith investors have in Musk, said David Whiston, equity strategist at Morningstar. Even with this week's losses, Tesla's market value is $52.12 billion, slightly higher than General Motors. ""Without the cult of personality around Elon, they're just a cult of personality that's burning a lot of cash."" It's clear from the interview that Musk is overworked, and Whiston said the best course may be to bring in another executive to help with day-to-day operations. The challenge would be finding someone good at the job yet willing to work at a company so dominated by one person, Whiston said. The Times cited people familiar with the situation as saying Tesla has been trying to find a No. 2 executive to help relieve some of the pressure on Musk. Tesla's board earlier this week formed a special committee to evaluate proposals to take the company private. Tesla later disclosed that Musk had talked with the Saudi Arabia government investment fund about a deal. ____ Krisher reported from Detroit. Choe reported from New York.",0,8,Auto CEO,65

RETAIL SALES US retail sales climb in May by the most in 6 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. retail sales rose by the most in six months in May, as consumers spent more at home and garden stores, gas stations and restaurants. The Commerce Department says retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, the largest increase since November. Excluding the volatile gas and auto categories, sales also rose 0.8 percent. Consumers are very confident in the economic outlook, buoyed by steady job gains, an unemployment rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, and the Trump administration's tax cuts. The solid job gains have meant more Americans earning paychecks to spend. Healthier consumer spending is accelerating growth after a sluggish first quarter.

In its annual assessment of the U.S. economy, the IMF says growth will hit 2.9 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year. Both are significant increases from last year's 2.3 percent expansion. However, after an initial boost from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package, the IMF forecasts growth will slow steadily in future years, dropping to 1.4 percent in 2023. This forecast is far below the Trump administration, which is predicting its economic program will deliver growth of 3 percent or better in coming years.

855,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A former Tesla Inc. employee at the electric car maker's battery plant in Nevada is seeking at least $1 million in defamation damages after it accused him of sabotage, hacking into computers and stealing confidential information leaked to the media. Lawyers for Martin Tripp filed a counterclaim in federal court this week alleging any damages Tesla incurred were caused or contributed to by Tesla's ""own negligence, acts or omissions."" Tripp alleges that between $150 million and $200 million worth of battery module parts for Tesla's Model 3 vehicle were incorrectly handled as scrap earlier this year. He said more than 700 dented and/or punctured battery modules were not discarded and instead were being shipped or were in the process of being shipped to customers. A punctured battery could pose a fire risk. Tesla officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday. Tripp said he was recruited by Tesla, moved to Sparks, Nevada, from Wisconsin and started working at the battery factory in October 2017 as a lead process engineering technician. He was fired June 19. Tesla filed the lawsuit against Tripp on June 20, three days after Musk warned employees of sabotage from within the company. In the months prior, Tripp witnessed ""several concerning business practices"" inconsistent with Tesla's representations to investors and the general public, according to his counterclaim filed in U.S. District Court in Reno on Tuesday. Tripp said he repeatedly questioned supervisors about the large quantities of waste and scrap vehicle parts he observed ""lying haphazardly on the ground inside the Gigafactory."" But his concerns were never addressed or resolved, Tripp said. Tripp said he emailed CEO Elon Musk directly about his concerns on May 16 before Musk was scheduled to visit the factory east of Sparks that night. Later that day, Tripp said his manager asked him to forward the email he sent to Musk ""so that I can avoid getting fired tonight,"" according to the lawsuit. His counterclaim says a design engineer also told Tripp to clean up the production line area so Musk wouldn't see the mounds of scrap and waste lying on the ground, but Tripp declined to do so because he wanted Musk ""to see how the Gigafactory was actually being operated."" He said he was reassigned to a different position the following day. Tesla's original lawsuit said Tripp admitted to Tesla investigators that he wrote software that transferred several gigabytes of data outside the company, including dozens of photographs and a video, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday. Hacking software from Tripp also was running on three computer systems of other employees ""so that the data would be exported even after he left the company and so that those individuals would be falsely implicated,"" the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit said Tripp made false claims about the information he stole, including claims that Tesla used punctured battery cells in the Model 3, and claims about the amount and value of scrap material generated by Tesla's manufacturing process. Some of the claims made it into media stories about the company, but media organizations are not identified in the lawsuit. Tripp, a former aviation electronics technician in the U.S. Navy who worked two decades in the electronic and engineering industries, said in his counterclaim he ""did not sabotage Tesla or its operations"" and his actions ""were necessary, reasonable and/or privileged."" He acknowledged in the counterclaim that he had made claims about the scrap and punctured battery cells being used in Model 3 vehicles. But he said he did not direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false user names or export large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data as Musk had asserted. After he was reassigned to a new position, Tripp ""learned of and witnessed additional unnerving, dangerous and wasteful business practices,"" including employees systematically reusing parts and battery cells that had been previously discarded as waste, the suit said. The scrap problem dramatically increased in March 2018 when Tesla initiated a company-wide effort to reach its publicized goal of producing 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week, the lawsuit said. It said the production push — with an objective of making 5,000 vehicles per week by July 2018 — was known as the ""March to 2,500.""",1766,1774,Auto CEO,67

949,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk's elaboration on his plan to engineer a buyout of the electric car maker could get the Silicon Valley maverick into legal trouble by revealing that the deal is far more uncertain than how he initially described it in his brash tweet last week. If everything falls into place, Musk plans to buy Tesla from any existing shareholders willing to sell using money raised through Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Until his , Musk hadn't identified the source for financing a deal that analysts estimate could cost anywhere from $25 billion to $50 billion. But when he initially dropped his bombshell in , Musk stated he had ""funding secured"" to buy Tesla stock at $420 per share — 23 percent above its August 6 closing price. That assurance caused Tesla's stock to surge 11 percent in one day, boosting the company's market value by more than $6 billion to the dismay investors who had been betting Tesla's shares would decline. It now appears as if financing for the deal is far from locked up, although Musk wrote on Monday that he was encouraged to pursue the buyout in a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Discussions have continued this month, Musk wrote, while adding the caveat that the deal remained ""subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals."" That contingency contradicts the financing guarantee that Musk issued in a tweet that already has opened an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to published reports. At least two lawsuits seeking to become a class action also have been filed against Tesla, alleging Musk broke securities laws by making it sound like all the financing for the buyout had been lined up. ""'Funding secured' wasn't exactly funding secured,"" said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and former SEC lawyer. ""There are some issues here."" After reading Musk's Monday post, former SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest concluded the chances of regulators taking action against Musk are now ""quite high."" He believes Musk, who runs cutting-edge aerospace company SpaceX in addition to Tesla, opened a ""self-inflicted wound"" by announcing the buyout in last week's nine-word tweet instead of spelling out the situation like he did in Monday's post. ""What Elon Musk is trying to do with electric cars and rockets is hard enough without creating more problems for yourself with bad Twitter hygiene,"" Grundfest said. Tesla wouldn't comment on a possible SEC investigation or why it took a week for details to be released in the blog. The SEC also declined comment Monday. Six of Tesla's nine board members said last week they there are evaluating Musk's proposal, which would end Tesla's eight-year history as a public company and relieve some of the mounting pressure to reverse its long history of losses. Besides making assurances about the deal's financing, Musk also sent out another tweet that asserted the only uncertainty was whether the majority of shareholders would approve it. That statement also helped drive up Tesla's stock, irritating investors such as Mark Spiegel, whose Stanphyl Capital investment firm has been a long-time ""short seller"" of the shares. Short sellers borrow shares in a company's stock and sell them immediately on the premise they can be replaced at a lower price in the future. ""My guess is he was fooling around,"" Spiegel said of Musk's early tweets about the buyout. ""He probably was getting a good laugh out of it."" Although Musk only recently broached the possibility of buying out Tesla with its board, he wrote Monday that the Saudi Arabian fund had approached him about taking the company private multiple times during the past two years. Founded in 1971, the Public Investment Fund ranks among the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, giving it the means to buy out Tesla. It already holds about $250 billion investments around the world, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, including a $3.5 billion stake in the biggest ride-hailing service, Uber. Buying all of Tesla's stock would currently cost $72 billion, but a buyout of the Palo Alto, California, company probably wouldn't require as much money. That's because Musk owns roughly 20 percent of Tesla's stock and he envisions two-third of the company's current shareholders retaining their stakes in a newly created special fund. If only one-third of Tesla's stock is sold in a buyout offer, it would cost nearly $24 billion. Other analysts have estimated financing a Tesla buyout would cost closer to $50 billion. Investors are much more skeptical about Musk being able to pull off a buyout than they were after his first tweet about the deal. Tesla's stock crept up 92 cents Monday to close at $356.41, well below Musk's proposed bid. Even if the financing is in place, the deal might not come together because it would involve foreign interests buying at least one-third of a U.S. company that is trying to revolutionize the auto industry with its electric vehicles. The government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States would likely would review this deal because of Tesla's technology and the likelihood that a foreign country would get at least one board seat to gain some control over a U.S. company, said Jeremy Zucker, co-head of the international trade practice at Dechert LLP in Washington, D.C. Whether it's technology pertaining to longer-life batteries or technology pertaining to what's behind the dashboard in a Tesla car, ""I can see CFIUS viewing these technologies as of potential national security interest,"" he said. ____ Krisher reported from Detroit.

972,"Tesla's shares are tumbling before the market open Thursday after the electric vehicle maker posted a record first-quarter loss and its CEO got testy at times during a conference call. Tesla tore through $745.3 million in cash in the quarter, due largely to the slow production ramp-up of the Model 3 mass-market electric sedan. When questioned on the Model 3 by an analyst, Elon Musk cut him off, calling questions dry and ""not cool."" He then allowed multiple questions from a person via YouTube. RBC Capital Markets' Joseph Spak called it an ""odd conference call that lacked answers to questions on investors' minds and overshadowed earnings."" ""The general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes,"" he added in an analyst note. Shares dropped more than 7 percent in premarket trading.",375,383,Auto CEO,61
987,"Elon Musk is known for his bold predictions on electric and self-driving cars. Now his pay could depend on whether those predictions come true. Under a new all-or-nothing pay package, Musk would remain at Tesla Inc. for the next decade and see his compensation tied to ambitious growth targets. The proposal, revealed Tuesday in a regulatory filing, requires that Tesla grow in $50 billion leaps, to a staggering $650 billion market capitalization. The electric car maker, based in Palo Alto, California, is worth less than $60 billion today. Tesla must hit a series of escalating revenue and adjusted profit targets, only after which Musk would vest stock options worth 1 percent of company shares.  He would get no other guaranteed compensation. The pay package, developed over the last six months by Tesla's board, still needs the approval of Tesla shareholders, who will vote on it at a special meeting in late March. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is a Tesla board member, will recuse themselves from the vote. If the goals are reached, Tesla would be one of the biggest companies in America. The $650 billion benchmark would make Tesla the fourth-most valuable U.S. company, behind only Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. based on current valuations. It would be larger than Microsoft Corp., and would exceed the current combined valuation of the world's top eight publicly-traded auto companies. The pay scheme would also catapult Musk into the ranks of the world's richest people. Musk's stock options could be worth up to $55.8 billion if he meets the company's goals. He also would own a 28 percent stake in Tesla, which would be worth $182 billion. Forbes' current richest billionaire, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, is worth $86 billion. Musk has long had ambitious plans for Tesla. In a 2015 earnings call with analysts and media, he predicted Tesla could match Apple in total value by 2025. Musk's growth plans were laid out in a 2016 blog post he titled ""Master Plan, Part Deux."" Tesla plans to expand from electric cars and SUVs to trucks — including a semi due out in 2019 — and buses. It will continue to work on autonomous vehicle technology and plans to enter the car-sharing business, letting Tesla owners share their cars when they're not using them and running Tesla-owned fleets in cities. The company, which bought solar panel maker SolarCity Corp. in 2016, also plans to expand its solar panel and energy storage businesses. Tesla is making solar panels and roof tiles at its factory in Buffalo, New York, which will help the company blunt any impact from President Donald Trump's recent 30-percent tariff on imported solar panels and cell modules. The plans are ambitious, but that's nothing new for Tesla. Under a 2012 agreement, Musk's stock options vested only if the Tesla's market cap continued to rise in $4 billion increments. The company also had to hit matching operational milestones, including vehicle production targets and developmental milestones tied to the Model X and Model 3 programs. Tesla wound up reaching all of the market cap milestones and nine of the 10 operational milestones, falling short only of its goal to have four consecutive quarters with 30-percent gross margins. When that pay package was created, the company was worth just $3.2 billion. Its market cap at the end of last year was 17 times that amount. That's why the new goals may not be that far-fetched, says Michael Ramsey, an analyst with Gartner who follows Tesla. ""To this point, it has been dangerous to predict failure for Tesla or Elon,"" he said. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley who follows Tesla, thinks plan is partly a marketing tool as the competition for electric and autonomous vehicle talent heats up. Jonas added that Musk — who owns 21.9 percent of Tesla shares — is already ""all-in"" on the company, so he sees the incentive package as more for investor confidence than for Musk's personal benefit. In order to vest shares when milestones are reached, Musk must stay on as CEO or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer. That would give Tesla the option of hiring a different CEO. Tesla said while it doesn't currently intend for Musk to step away from the CEO role, the terms allow him to potentially focus his attention on key products and strategy. The amount of time Musk divides between Tesla and other ventures has been a concern for investors. Musk is also the founder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX and the co-founder and chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit that researches artificial intelligence. He also recently started The Boring Co., which hopes to build tunnels beneath Los Angeles and other major cities for high-speed transit. Musk has never made a salary at Tesla, which is unusual but not unheard of for a CEO. Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford didn't take a salary or bonus for five years starting in 2005 when the company's fortunes were sagging. Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison has a $1 salary but takes home millions in stock awards. And Steve Jobs took home $1 per year when he was Apple's CEO from 1997 to 2011. Tesla — which turns 15 this year — has never earned a full-year profit. It has reported only two profitable quarters since it went public in 2010. Each of the four vehicles it has made has faced significant delays and production problems. Its newest vehicle, the lower-cost Model 3 sedan, is no exception. Musk initially said Tesla would be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by the end of 2017, but he recently pushed that goal to the end of the second quarter. That hasn't dimmed investors' appetite for Tesla's stock. Tesla shares were up less than 1 percent to $352 in afternoon trading. They've risen around 40 percent over the last year. ___ Durbin reported from Detroit.",0,8,Auto CEO,70
1042,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. is laying off about 3,600 workers mainly from its salaried ranks as it slashes costs in an effort to deliver on CEO Elon Musk's promise to turn a profit in the second half of the year. In an email to workers on Tuesday, Musk said the cuts amount to about 9 percent of the company's workforce of 40,000. Tesla would not say how much money the layoffs would save, but said no factory workers would be affected as the company continues to ramp up production of its lower-priced Model 3 compact car. The move is part of an organizational restructuring that Musk announced earlier in the year. ""Tesla has grown and evolved rapidly over the past several years, which has resulted in some duplication of roles and some job functions that, while they made sense in the past, are difficult to justify today,"" Musk wrote in the email. He thanked departing employees for their hard work and said Tesla is providing ""significant salary and stock vesting"" to those being let go, based on their length of service. Tesla has not made an annual profit in its 15 years of doing business, and it has posted only two quarterly net profits. At the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said he expected the Palo Alto, California, company to post a quarterly profit during the July-September period. For nearly all of its history, Tesla has put up losses while investing heavily in technology, manufacturing plants and an extensive car-charging network. It's not the first time Tesla has laid off workers. The company let go of 400 to 700 workers last fall after completing annual performance reviews, and it laid off a small number of workers back in 2008. Musk wrote in the email that the company will never achieve its mission to help move the world to cleaner energy ""unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable."" The company is making the move now so it never has to do it again, he wrote. Tesla still has a significant need for production workers as it tries to reach Model 3 manufacturing targets, he wrote in the email. The layoffs come in engineering, sales and other front-office functions, but the company says the remaining workforce is large enough to accomplish Musk's lofty goals of rolling out a semi, pickup truck and a new SUV in the coming years. Tesla shares rose 2.5 percent to $340.34 in afternoon trading, after reaching as high as $354.97 around noon. Musk also announced that the company's solar panel unit has decided to end its agreement to sell via Home Depot stores so it can focus on sales in Tesla's company stores and online. A majority of Tesla employees working at Home Depot will get offers to work in Tesla's own stores. Consumer Edge Research Analyst James Albertine wrote in a note to investors that he views the moves ""as a positive in helping Tesla track toward profitability later this year."" He wrote that reaching Musk's Model 3 production goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of June is still the primary driver of profitability. ""A focus on 'getting lean' is a positive with respect to Tesla's guidance for achieving consolidated profitability in 2018, in our view,"" he wrote. The Model 3 starts at $35,000, but lower-priced configurations are not available yet. It can easily top $50,000 with options.",161,169,Auto CEO,71

1122,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker, according to media reports. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors, . The newspaper cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter after Fox Business News reported the SEC's move. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with revealing that he had lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell. The subpoena signals regulators have now opened a formal investigation into whether Musk was telling the truth in his tweet about have financing locked up for a deal that analysts have estimated would require $25 billion to $50 billion. Under a scenario sketched out by Musk , the deal would cost at the lower end of those estimates. Musk also revealed in the same post that he had been talking to Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund about providing the money for a buyout that would end Tesla's eight-year history as a publicly held company, but he added that the financing was still contingent on due diligence. Corporate governance experts say that caveat shows the financing of the deal isn't finalized, as Musk initially indicated, a contradiction that could be used to prove he deliberately misled investors with his tweet. After Musk dropped his bombshell, Tesla's stock surged 11 percent in one day, damaging a class of investors who had been betting the company's shares would decline. Musk has had a long-running battle with that group of investors, who are known as ""short sellers"" in Wall Street's parlance. Tesla's stock has backtracked since that one-day pop last week, but at least two lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of shareholders alleging Musk broke the law with his tweet, and now the SEC is taking a closer look too.

1268,"Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has delivered on its CEO's promise to build a lower-priced car at a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of June. CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to company employees Sunday praising them for producing 5,000 Model 3s, a compact car that's designed to shift Tesla from a niche manufacturer to a mainstream automaker. Musk also said the company had cranked out a combined 2,000 of Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles, bringing overall production to a record 7,000 for the week. ""We did it!"" Musk wrote. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team."" The e-mail was reported by the website Electrek, and the company confirmed its authenticity. Last summer, when the first Model 3s began rolling off the assembly line, Musk promised to build 5,000 per week by December and 10,000 per week in 2018. But he also warned at the time that Tesla was entering at least six months of ""manufacturing hell"" as it tried to hit the targets. Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at the market research firm AutoPacific Inc., wasn't impressed. ""Reaching it is one thing,"" Sullivan said. ""Consistently producing 5,000 per week with outstanding quality is another. I don't think producing 5,000 once is anything to get excited about until it's repeatable."" Model 3 sales are critical to Tesla's future. The company has never posted a full-year profit, and it burned through more than $1 billion in cash in the first quarter. Wall Street investors, who have pushed the company's stock beyond $340 per share, are growing impatient with the losses. Moody's Investor Service downgraded Tesla's debt into junk territory back in March, warning that Tesla won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla said cash from Model 3 sales will pay the bills and drive profits. The company reached 5,000 per week as Musk spent many nights inside the Fremont, California, factory that once belonged to a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota. To quickly put another assembly line in place, Tesla built a large tent at the factory site. Musk told investors on a first-quarter earnings conference call that the company relied too heavily on automation. It had to hire more people to work at the factory. Tesla said in April that it had about 450,000 orders for the Model 3. But some could be getting antsy, especially those who want a price closer to the base of $35,000. Currently Tesla is selling only Model 3s that cost $49,000 to in excess of $70,000. Many have been waiting since March of 2016, when Tesla began taking orders with a $1,000 refundable deposit. The company also may have to deal with some safety issues. Investigators from two federal agencies are looking into five crashes of its vehicles, some involving the semi-autonomous Autopilot system or post-crash battery fires that have been difficult to extinguish. But regardless of those issues, Musk was in a celebratory mood Sunday. ""I think we just became a real car company,"" he wrote. ___ AP Business Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this story.",145,153,Auto CEO,75
1282,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking relief from the pressures of running a publicly held company with a $72 billion buyout of the electric car maker, but he may be acquiring new headaches with his peculiar handling of the proposed deal. Almost everything about the deal is outlandish, from Musk's out-of-the-blue disclosure in a to the assertion that he has lined up adequate financing to a buy a company that seems to burn through cash faster than it produces cars. If Musk can pull it off, he will have burnished his reputation as an eccentric visionary who has been compared to Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy depicted by actor Robert Downey Jr. in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But if the buyout flops, Musk and Tesla will likely face class-action lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were duped, and potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. The SEC already has opened an inquiry into the wording and method of Musk's disclosure about the deal, , which cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. ""It's very obvious that Musk did not talk to any lawyers before he made his tweet,"" said John Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor and corporate-governance expert. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The SEC declined to comment. Skepticism about the legitimacy of Musk's proposed deal surfaced almost immediately after Musk dropped the bombshell on his Twitter account a few hours after the stock market opened Tuesday. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk tweeted, without elaboration or any corroboration from the company. It took about two hours before Tesla posted to company employees on its website elaborating on his reasons for wanting to do the deal, making it clear he was serious. Before that happened, Tesla's stock had already soared. Trading in Tesla's stock was eventually halted until everyone could figure out what was going on. It wasn't until Wednesday when six directors on Tesla's nine-member board publicly acknowledged that Musk approached them last week about pursuing the financing for a buyout that would take the company off the stock market. Like Musk's tweet and email to employees, the directors' statement didn't contain details on how the buyout would be financed. The murkiness of the financing could turn into a legal mine field for Musk and Tesla, according to both Coffee and former SEC lawyer Pete Henning, now a law professor at Wayne State University. That's because Musk tweeted that the financing for the buyout had been locked up without equivocation. If there is an indication the financing is shaky, it almost certainly will expose the company and its CEO to allegations of market manipulation or fraud, Coffee and Henning said. News of the potential buyout already has stung investors known as ""short sellers"" who have long been a thorn in Musk's side. Short sellers borrow company stock and then resell the shares in the open market in a bet that they will be able to replace them at a much lower price in the near future to repay their debt. Tesla's stock surged 11 percent on Tuesday, collectively costing short sellers more than $1 billion, by some estimates. ""If (Musk's) motive was frustration with short sellers, then that could be a case of market manipulation,"" Coffee said. Those who believe Musk is carrying out a vendetta against short sellers may point to suggesting he might have something up his sleeve. ""Oh and uh short burn of the century comin (sic) soon,"" he wrote. Musk's use of Twitter to announce a huge deal also raised eyebrows, but that probably didn't violate any laws, Coffee and Henning said. The SEC has previously ruled that using social media to disclose company news is OK, as along as investors have been told that those channels may be used. Tesla disclosed in a that shareholders should follow Musk's Twitter account to keep up with company news. Even though Musk has 22.3 million followers on Twitter, Tesla probably should have ensured even wider distribution of the news by simultaneously posting information on its website and filing documents with the SEC, Coffee and Henning said. Some of the fervor for a Tesla buyout faded Wednesday. Tesla's stock backtracked by more than 2 percent to close at $370.34. One of the biggest questions surrounding the buyout is Tesla's long history of losing money while it has been investing in electric car technology and ramping up production of its vehicles. The Palo Alto, California, company has only posted a quarterly profit twice in its history and has never made money during an entire calendar year, something that Musk has been trying to change by cutting costs, including recent mass layoffs that trimmed Tesla's workforce by 9 percent. Tesla lost another $717.5 million in its most recent quarter. Musk has promised to begin making money on a consistent basis starting in the third quarter, escalating the pressure that he has already publicly acknowledged has taken an immense toll on him. Just last week, to deliver on short-term promises he had made to Wall Street, a load he traced to his boorish behavior toward two analysts earlier this year. ""It's very clear that he doesn't like to deal with being a CEO of a public company,"" said Gene Munster, a former stock market analyst who is now managing partner of investment fund Loup Ventures. ""I am not sure it is beating him down, but I am sure he is sick of it."" By taking Tesla private, Musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring from one quarter to the next. Buying Tesla in its entirety would cost $72 billion, based on the company's outstanding stock as of July 27. But Musk probably doesn't need that much financing because he owns a roughly 20 percent stake in the company and he is also creating a special fund that will allow existing shareholders to retain their stakes in Tesla in the private market, if they want. Munster estimates Musk will need $25 billion to $30 billion to buy out all the Tesla shareholders who want to sell at $420. Tesla also would likely need to borrow billions more to help pay for its ambitious plans of its electric vehicle line and its battery manufacturing plants. In a Wednesday research note, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated Tesla will end up taking on about $50 billion in additional debt if the company goes private. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this story.",31,39,Auto CEO,76
1294,"FINANCIAL MARKETS Stocks mixed NEW YORK (AP) — Stock indexes are mixed in midday trading on Wall Street as gains by industrial and financial companies are offset by losses elsewhere. United Continental soared 9.3 percent after reporting strong quarterly results, but technology companies fell. Texas Instruments dropped 1.1 percent after firing its CEO after less than two months on the job for personal misconduct. Railroad operator CSX rose 6.5 percent after beating analysts' earnings forecasts in its latest quarter. Bond prices didn't move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 2.86 percent. HOME CONSTRUCTION US housing starts tumbled 12.3 percent in June WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. homebuilders sharply curtailed the pace of construction in June as housing starts plummeted 12.3 percent. The Commerce Department says that housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million from 1.34 million in May. Housing starts plunged 35.8 percent in the Midwest and declined less severely in the Northeast, South and West. Still, the drop-off might only reflect the volatile nature of the monthly report. A steady job market and a shortage of existing homes for sale have bolstered housing starts for the first half of 2018. New home construction has climbed 7.8 percent year-to-date. But builders also face cost pressures from a lack of available land and construction workers, as well as from higher commodity prices from the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. EUROPE-GOOGLE-ANDROID EU fines Google a record $5 billion over mobile system BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union fined Google a record $5 billion Wednesday for using the market dominance of its Android mobile operating system to force handset makers to install Google apps, reducing choice for consumers. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google went against EU rules when it required mobile phone producers to pre-install the Google Search and browser apps as a condition for licensing Google's app store. She said Google also paid big producers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app. Vestager said that ""companies must compete on their merits,"" playing by antitrust rules that favor consumers and open markets, and not restrict competition. Google said it would appeal. ""Android has created more choice for everyone, not less,"" said company spokesman Al Verney. The EU's fine is the biggest ever imposed on a company for anticompetitive behavior. EUROPE-STEEL EU tries to limit influx of steel diverted by US tariffs BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union has announced measures to shield its market from a glut of steel heading to the continent after the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of the metal. The Trump administration put tariffs this year on steel and aluminum from several countries, including the 28 of the EU. The EU now fears that steel from around the world that would have gone to the U.S. will be diverted to the EU, swamping its market. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said that ""we are left with no other choice than to introduce provisional safeguard measures to protect our domestic industry against a surge of imports."" Under the measures, the EU will impose tariffs of 25 percent on 23 categories of products if imports exceed a 3-year average. TRADE-URANIUM-INVESTIGATION US launches national security probe into uranium imports WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department has started an investigation into the impact of uranium imports on U.S. national security, a move that could result in tariffs and add another front to the Trump administration's trade fight. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the United States produces just 5 percent of the uranium needed for the U.S. military and for electricity generation, down from nearly half in 1987. Two U.S. uranium mining companies, UR-Energy and Energy Fuels, requested the investigation in January. The probe follows an earlier national security investigation into steel and aluminum imports, which resulted in steep 25 percent duties on imports of the two metals from the European Union, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. A second investigation focused on the threat to security posed by auto imports is ongoing. ZIONS BANCORP-FINANCIAL THREAT TAG Regulators seek end to stricter oversight of Zions Bancorp WASHINGTON (AP) — A panel of federal regulators is proposing the removal of strict government oversight imposed on Zions Bancorp after the big regional bank received a taxpayer-funded bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The unanimous decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Wednesday is the latest example of a push, under the Trump administration, to dismantle rules put into place after the financial meltdown in hopes of averting a similar crisis in the future. A final action on the Salt Lake City bank is likely within 60 days. The council was empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to collar some large financial companies with stricter supervision as a way to avert a ""too-big-to-fail"" situation — when the government is forced rescue them to head off a broader economic collapse. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY-BUYBACKS Berkshire Hathaway stock jumps after buyback rules eased OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is up 4 percent after easing restrictions on buying back its own shares. The Omaha, Nebraska, conglomerate led by Warren Buffett said Tuesday that after it posts earnings on Aug. 3, it will begin allowing Buffett to buy stock at prices up to the shares' intrinsic value. Since 2012, Berkshire has restricted buybacks to prices below 120 percent of the stock's book value, which is an estimate of the company's value after liabilities are subtracted from assets. Given the company's massive cash pile (Berkshire has hoarded more than $100 billion while Buffett looks for another acquisition or investment) the rule change ups the odds that it will be directed at buybacks. It will not do so if it would reduce its cash below $20 billion. FEDERAL RESERVE-POWELL Powell gets praise for plain speaking WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is getting praise from lawmakers for his efforts to avoid economic jargon in explaining what the Federal Reserve is trying to do to manage the economy and also for pushing for more openness at the central bank. Powell tells lawmakers, ""We have this precious grant on independence. We have to earn it."" Powell, the first non-economist to head the Fed in nearly four decades, says his goal is to speak so that he can be understood not just by economists and Wall Street investors but also by the typical household. He noted that he has already announced he will double the number of press conference he holds each year from four to eight — one after every Fed meeting starting next year. TESLA-WAITING LIST Buyers worry they'll lose tax credit while waiting on Tesla DETROIT (AP) — For many on the list to buy Tesla's mass-market electric car, the wait for the company to produce enough to satisfy demand isn't a major problem. But the prospect of losing a U.S. federal tax credit is. While CEO Elon Musk's company uses a tent to create more factory space and crank out more Model 3s, many on the waiting list worry about the looming phaseout of the $7,500 credit on Tesla vehicles. If it goes away, the car could cost too much, forcing them to cancel orders. That could cost Tesla critical sales and revenue at a time when the company will need a lot of cash.

The company has been reducing low-profit sales to rental car companies. Many automakers use those sales to boost monthly numbers. GM says it will report March sales Tuesday with other automakers, then switch to quarters. TESLA-SALES Tesla raises production but falls short of Model 3 goals DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. increased production of its Model 3 mass-market car in the first quarter but still fell far short of the numbers it promised last summer. The Palo Alto, California, company says it made just under 9,800 Model 3s from January through March. That's four times what it made in the fourth quarter. But it's still only a fraction of the 20,000 per month that CEO Elon Musk promised when the car first went into production. Tesla's shares rose nearly 5 percent to $264.82 in early trading Tuesday. Tesla says it made just under 35,000 vehicles in the quarter including the Models S and X. That's a 40 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. The company says it addressed Model 3 production and parts supply bottlenecks. JAPAN-TOSHIBA Toshiba CEO promises turnaround in 5 years, beefed up ethics TOKYO (AP) — An outsider tapped to lead scandal-tarnished Japanese electronics company Toshiba Corp. is promising a turnaround in five years by reshaping its operations. Nobuaki Kurumatani, the first outsider to be appointed chief executive at Toshiba in more than half a century, acknowledged corporate governance had been weak. He told reporters Tuesday at Toshiba's Tokyo headquarters that he brought his experience in the financial sector, where compliance controls are tougher. Toshiba has been embroiled in an accounting scandal involving the massive doctoring of books. It also racked up heavy losses in its nuclear business and is selling its lucrative computer-chip business to avoid going belly-up. At the center of the losses is the acquisition of CB&I Stone & Webster by its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year. FACEBOOK PRIVACY SCANDAL-USER POLL Facebook asks users if they think it's 'good for the world' NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is asking users whether they think it's ""good for the world"" in a poll sent to an unspecified number of people.

Localytics and Apptimize were paid to test and monitor how the app is used. The company says the firms are under ""strict contractual terms that provide for the highest level of confidentiality."" Grindr says data that may include location or information from HIV status fields are ""always transmitted securely with encryption."" Grindr says it's important to remember it is a public forum and users have the option to post information about their HIV status and date when last tested.

SUPPLEMENT-SALMONELLA RECALL FDA orders recall of salmonella-tainted herbal supplement WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health authorities are ordering a Las Vegas company to pull its herbal supplements off the market because some of its products tested positive for salmonella, part of a nationwide outbreak linked to the ingredient kratom. The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it took the rare step of ordering the recall because Triangle Pharmanaturals refused to cooperate with regulators. Companies typically issue their own recalls of tainted products. Various brands of kratom supplements have been linked to nearly 90 cases of salmonella across 35 states, according to federal figures. Sold in various capsules and powders, kratom has gained popularity in the U.S. as an alternative treatment for pain, anxiety and drug dependence. The FDA says the ingredient is dangerous and has no approved medical use. WATER PARK FATALITY-CHARGES Agents arrest designer of Kansas water slide that killed boy DALLAS (AP) — Federal authorities in Dallas have arrested one of the designers of a Kansas water park slide that decapitated a 10-year-old boy. Trent Touchstone, chief deputy with the U.S. Marshals Service in Dallas, said Tuesday that 72-year-old John Timothy Schooley was met by agents at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport late Monday. Schooley will be held in Dallas pending his arraignment and extradition to Kansas on charges that include second-degree murder. A Kansas grand jury last week indicted Schooley and Jeffrey Henry, a co-owner of Texas-based Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts. The indictment alleges Schooley lacked technical or engineering expertise in amusement park rides.

PRODUCTIVITY US productivity grows at tepid 0.7 percent rate in Q1 WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. productivity grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, a weak reading but a slight improvement from the previous quarter. The Labor Department says that the first quarter increase followed an even weaker 0.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter of last year. Labor costs rose at a 2.7 percent rate in the first quarter, the fastest gain in a year. Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, is a key factor determining how fast the economy can grow and how much living standards can increase. Productivity gains have been lackluster for most of this recovery, increasing just 1.3 percent for all of 2017. Economists are uncertain why productivity has been so tepid. ECONOMY-SERVICES US services firms grew in April at slowest pace this year WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. services firms grew at a slower pace in April compared to the prior month, as companies are reporting cost pressures from possible tariffs and a shortage of available workers. The Institute for Supply Management says its services index fell to 56.8, from 58.8 in March. This marks to lowest reading of the index this year. Still, any reading above 50 is a sign of expansion. The services sector has been expanding for the past 99 months, or more than eight years. The index is drawn from a survey of purchasing managers in the services industry, which includes finance, health care and retail and accounts for the majority of U.S. economic activity. The employment and production components of the index decreased in April, although both pointed to continued growth. TRADE GAP Record exports cut US trade deficit to $49 billion WASHINGTON (AP) — Record exports trimmed the U.S. trade deficit in March for the first time in seven months. The Commerce Department says the trade gap slid to $49 billion, down from $57.7 billion in February and lowest since September. Exports rose in March to a record $208.5 billion, led by shipments of civilian aircraft and soybeans. Imports slipped 1.8 percent to $257.5 billion. President Donald Trump has vowed to bring down America's massive deficits, which he blames on bad trade agreements and abusive practices by U.S. trading partners. Top administration officials are visiting Beijing this week for talks aimed at reducing America's huge trade deficit in goods with China, which fell 11.6 percent in March to $25.9 billion. So far this year, the trade gap is up 18.5 percent to $163.4 billion. MORTGAGE-RATES US key mortgage rate declines slightly to 4.55 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — The key long-term U.S. mortgage rate declined slightly this week, after a steady rise for most of April that pushed the rate to its highest level in more than four years. With the spring buying season underway, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages slipped to 4.55 percent from 4.58 percent last week. By contrast, the benchmark rate averaged 4.02 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans ticked up to 4.03 percent from 4.02 percent last week. REVEAL-REDLINING-BERKSHIRE-HATHAWAY Buffett's mortgage companies found to cater to white clients UNDATED (AP) — Mortgages lenders controlled by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway are making the vast majority of their home loans to white borrowers in a way that former prosecutors say may violate the Fair Housing Act, a 50-year-old law that banned racial discrimination in lending. That's according to a new exposé by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. The non-profit newsroom examined the records of three lenders under Berkshire Hathaway's corporate umbrella. It found the companies -- HomeServices Lending, Prosperity Home Mortgage, and Trident Mortgage Corporation --- employed overwhelmingly white teams of loan officers, placed their offices in white neighborhoods, and concentrated their lending in white neighborhoods. Among their biggest markets are Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC, where a majority of residents are people of color. TRADER-FRAUD CASE Appeals court reverses conviction of ex-Wall Street trader NEW YORK (AP) — An appeals court in New York says a former Wall Street trader can be released from prison because he was improperly convicted of taking advantage of a government bailout program. The ruling Thursday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals frees Jesse Litvak from a two-year prison sentence he was serving after his securities fraud conviction last year. Authorities say he was the first person convicted of a crime related to the program that used bailout funds in the financial meltdown to restart trading markets for mortgage-backed securities. It is the second time the appeals court has reversed a conviction of Litvak since he was indicted in 2013. The 2nd Circuit earlier reversed his conviction on charges of securities fraud, Troubled Asset Relief Program fraud and making false statements.

1536,SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Wall Street Journal is reporting that government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors. The Journal cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Fox Business News was the first to report the SEC's action. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with an August 7 tweet revealing that he lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell.

1540,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details of the agreement signed Tuesday were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. ""The tariffs may have accelerated their plans for sure, but longer term they need a presence in the largest auto market globally,"" said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne. Tesla has discussed opening a factory in China since at least 2016. ""Still need to see how it gets paid for, which has been a concern,"" Osborne added. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production. ___ AP Business Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.",909,917,Auto CEO,82

TESLA Tesla CEO's buyout bid raises eyebrows, legal concerns SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking relief from the pressures of running a publicly held company with a $72 billion buyout of the electric car maker, but he may be acquiring new headaches with his peculiar handling of the proposed deal. Almost everything about the deal is outlandish, from Musk's out-of-the-blue disclosure in a nine-word tweet to the assertion that he has lined up adequate financing to a buy a company that seems to burn through cash faster than it produces cars. If Musk can pull it off, he will have burnished his reputation as an eccentric visionary who has been compared to Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy depicted by actor Robert Downey Jr. in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But if the buyout flops, Musk and Tesla will likely face class-action lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were duped, and potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. The SEC already has opened an inquiry into the wording and method of Musk's disclosure about the deal, according to a Wednesday report in The Wall Street Journal , which cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. IMMIGRATION-BUSINESSES TARGETED Immigration raids in Nebraska, Minnesota target businesses OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A large federal law enforcement operation conducted Wednesday targeted businesses in Nebraska and Minnesota that officials say knowingly hired — and mistreated — immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. The investigative arm of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement — Homeland Security Investigations — led the operation that saw about a dozen businesses and plants raided and 17 business owners and managers indicted for fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Of those, 14 were taken into custody Wednesday and three were still being sought. Authorities also arrested more than 130 workers at various businesses, busing them to Grand Island, Nebraska, to be questioned and processed. Most of the arrests occurred in northern Nebraska and southern Minnesota. Several of the businesses were in O'Neill, Nebraska, a town of about 3,000 about 160 miles (260 kilometers) northwest of Omaha. Officials said they were still looking to take three owners or managers into custody as part of the operation. CONGRESSMAN-STOCK INDICTMENT GOP congressman from New York charged with insider trading NEW YORK (AP) — Republican U.S. Rep. Christopher Collins of New York was arrested Wednesday on charges he fed inside information he gleaned from sitting on the board of a biotechnology corporation to his son, helping family and friends dodge hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses when one of the company's drugs failed in a medical trial. Collins, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who was among the first sitting members of Congress to endorse his candidacy for the White House, pleaded not guilty to an indictment unsealed at a court in Manhattan. The indictment charges Collins, his son and the father of the son's fiancee with conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements to the FBI. Speaking to reporters in Buffalo hours after his release on bail, Collins, 68, professed his innocence and said he would remain on the ballot for re-election this fall. Prosecutors said the charges stem from Collins' decision to share with his son insider information about Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., a biotechnology company headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices in Auckland, New Zealand. Collins was the company's largest shareholder, with nearly 17 percent of its shares, and sat on its board. CALIFORNIA GAS LEAK Huge Los Angeles gas leak leads to $120 million settlement LOS ANGELES (AP) — Officials say a Southern California utility reached a nearly $120 million settlement over a massive blowout at a natural gas storage field that became the nation's largest known release of climate-changing methane and forced thousands to flee their Los Angeles homes almost three years ago. The settlement between Southern California Gas Co. and state and local governments aims to mitigate the greenhouse gases that spewed uncontrollably for nearly four months. The October 2015 blowout at an Aliso Canyon well sickened residents of the San Fernando Valley and led to evacuations of 8,000 homes. Under the settlement, the utility agreed to pay up to $25 million for a study of long-term health consequences; reimburse city, county and state governments for responding to the blowout; monitor chemicals in the air along the boundary of the facility for eight years; and not pass costs of the settlement along to ratepayers. Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the tentative deal, which will be open to public comment and requires court approval, addressed violations of health and safety codes, the illegal discharge of air contaminants and failure to report the release of hazardous materials. TAXI TURMOIL NYC moves to rein in Uber with cap on ride-hail vehicles NEW YORK (AP) — New York City moved Wednesday to regulate the explosive growth of Uber and other app-based ride services with a temporary cap on new licenses for ride-hailing services. The City Council approved a package of bills that included a one-year moratorium on new licenses for for-hire vehicles while the city studies the rapidly changing industry. The legislation also will allow the city to set a minimum wage for app-based drivers. Backers of the proposals said both the traditional yellow cab industry and drivers for app-based services are suffering as Uber cars flood the city's streets. They said the growth of ride-hailing apps has also worsened traffic congestion. Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said the councils' vote set a precedent for the world as companies like Uber and Lyft use technological innovation ""to return us to a time of sweated labor, destroying lives and livelihoods across the planet."" But Uber spokeswoman Alix Anfang said the pause on new vehicle licenses ""will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion.""

New rules floated by the Trump administration lay out what kinds of businesses can take a 20 percent deduction against income taxes under the new tax law. With the proposed rules issued Wednesday, the Treasury Department and the IRS had worked for six months to bring clarity to Congress' blueprint. But as with many aspects of the sweeping Republican tax law hustled through Congress last year, the requirements for the millions of ""pass-through"" businesses to score generous tax breaks are stunningly complex. The new rules affirm the requirement in the tax law that certain business owners like lawyers, accountants, doctors and consultants can't qualify for the full deduction if their annual income exceeds $157,000 for single tax filers and $315,000 for couples filing jointly.

143,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German automaker Volkswagen had record sales of 10.74 million vehicles last year, but its bid to remain the world's largest carmaker was disputed by rival Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. Volkswagen's sales rose 4.3 percent from 10.30 million in 2016, when the company passed Japan's Toyota to become the globe's largest auto producer for that year. The figures show the Wolfsburg-based company continuing its effort to move past a scandal that broke in September 2015 over cars it had rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests. Sales last year were boosted by a strong December, when sales rose 8.5 percent. For the year, the company saw big jumps in Russia and Brazil, and significant gains in China and the United States. ""We are thankful for the trust of our customers,"" CEO Matthias Mueller said in a statement. Carlos Ghosn, chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, told a committee of the French National Assembly that his group was the world's biggest with 10.6 million vehicles last year, the French business publication Les Echos reported.

980,"BEIJING (AP) — The biggest global auto show of the year showcases China's ambitions to become a leader in electric cars and the industry's multibillion-dollar scramble to roll out models that appeal to price-conscious but demanding Chinese drivers. Auto China 2018, which opens this week, follows Beijing's decision to allow full foreign ownership of Chinese automakers in a move to make the industry more flexible as it promotes electrics. The ruling Communist Party has transformed China into the biggest market for electrics with billions of dollars in subsidies to producers and buyers. Now, Beijing is winding down that support and shifting the financial burden to automakers with sales quotas that push them to develop models Chinese drivers want to buy. That is reflected in the auto show lineup: Global and Chinese brands including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. plan to display dozens of electrics and hybrids, from luxurious SUVs to compacts priced as low as 152,000 yuan ($24,000). Communist leaders see electric cars as both a way to clean up smog-choked cities and a key ingredient in plans to transform China into a global competitor in an array of technology fields from robotics to solar power to biotech. ""Just in the last two or three years, China rose from being a very small player in the global EV market to be nearly 50 percent of sales in 2017,"" said Christopher Robinson, who follows the industry for Lux Research. ""It attracted nearly every automaker in the world,"" said Robinson. Starting in 2019, automakers will be required to earn credits by selling electrics or else buy them from competitors. More stringent fuel efficiency standards will require a big share of each brand's sales to be non-gasoline models. Global automakers say electrics should account for 35 to over 50 percent of their China sales by 2025. ""There is huge potential for vehicle electrification here,"" said Roland Krueger, chairman of Infiniti Motor Co., Nissan's luxury brand. Chinese sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 154 percent in the first quarter over a year earlier to 143,000 units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That compares with sales of just under 200,000 for all of last year in the United States, the No. 2 market. GM plans to display five all-electric vehicles including a concept Buick SUV it says can travel 600 kilometers (375 miles) on one charge, plus a hybrid Cadillac XT5 28E. The Detroit automaker, which vies with VW for the status of China's biggest brand, is launching 10 electrics or hybrids in China from in 2016 to 2020. VW is due to launch 15 electrics and hybrids in the next two to three years as part of a 10 billion euro ($12 billion) development plan announced in November. Nissan is unveiling an electric model at the auto show designed for China and will display an updated version of its Leaf and an electric concept car. The Japanese automaker also plans to develop a lower-priced electric with a local partner, state-owned Dongfeng Motor Co. Two more versions of that are to be sold under their jointly owned Venucia brand. China's BYD Auto, the biggest global maker of electrics by volume with 2017 sales of 113,669 units, plans to unveil two new hybrid SUVs and an electric concept car. The company also plans to display nine other hybrid and plug-in electric models. Infiniti plans to display a concept sedan, the Q Inspiration, that Krueger said will be the basis for future electric models. The sleek Q Inspiration has no air-drawing engine, and thus no front grill — a change Krueger said was suggested by Chinese designers at Infiniti's Beijing studio. The car has the roomier back seat that has become standard among luxury brands that want to appeal to Chinese customers who have a driver and ride in back. ""The first car is going to cater specifically to the needs of the Chinese market,"" said Krueger. Ford Motor Co. has announced a ""product onslaught"" this month for China that includes at least 15 electrified vehicles and 35 other models through 2025. Ford's first plug-in hybrid in China, the Mondeo Energi, went on sale last month. Washington and other trading partners have been irked by the Chinese controls that required global automakers to work through state-owned local partners and imposed other restrictions. Automakers complained joint ventures were cumbersome and expensive but complied because they gained access to a market that passed the United States in 2009 as the world's biggest. Last year's sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans totaled 24.7 million units, compared with 17.2 million for the United States. The Cabinet's planning agency announced last week Beijing will loosen those controls by allowing full foreign ownership in the industry, starting with electric vehicle producers this year. Limits for commercial vehicles would end in 2020 and for all passenger vehicles in 2022. That would end a 50 percent cap on foreign ownership of an auto venture, a limit that required automakers to share technology with potential competitors, adding to President Donald Trump's trade complaints against Beijing. ""Now you're going to see the difference between the partners that you want and partners imposed on you,"" said Carlos Ghosn, chairman of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Ghosn said his companies were happy with their Chinese partners. But he said with electrics, autonomous driving and other innovations give companies a new chance to consider a partnership or work independently. ""Every time there is a new opportunity we're going to consider, should we go with a partner? What are the advantages? Or should we go by ourself?"" said Ghosn. ""This is a new freedom for carmakers, which is welcome."" Still, while electrics may be China's future, most brands lose money making them. Profits come from sales of SUVs that are wildly popular with Chinese drivers who see them as the safest option on the country's rough, chaotic roads. First-quarter SUVs sales rose 11.3 percent over a year earlier to 2.6 million, or almost 45 percent of all auto sales, according to CAAM. Electrics accounted for just over 2 percent. ___ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",5268,5279,Auto CEO,87

61,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor said Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings rose a lower-than-expected 3 percent, hurt by weaker overseas sales, while its operating income slumped to its lowest level since 2010. South Korea's largest automaker said its October-December net profit was 1.03 trillion won ($970 million) on sales of 24.5 trillion won ($23 billion). Operating income slumped 24 percent to 775 billion won ($730 million), missing estimates. Hyundai's annual net profit in 2017 was the lowest in eight years, sinking 25 percent to 4 trillion won ($3.8 billion). Hyundai said demand overseas was hurt by friction between China and South Korea over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. missile defense system. The maker of Kona SUVs sold 4.5 million vehicles in 2017, down 6 percent from a year earlier. Its domestic sales went up but outside Korea, sales dropped 8 percent. Last year may not be Hyundai's worst. The company forecasts growth in auto sales will likely be the slowest since the 2008 global financial crisis. Hyundai's failure to read a shift in consumer trends, as SUVs gained favor over sedans, has eroded the company's operating income since 2012. Hyundai belatedly rolled out more SUV models but sales were not strong enough to offset an overall decline in sales. Last year, the company also spent more on marketing after a spinoff of Genesis to build a stand-alone premium brand and the launch of the Kona, its first subcompact SUV.

95,"DETROIT (AP) — Among the many shiny models vying for attention at Detroit's North American International Auto Show are the revamped Volkswagen Jetta, Hyundai Veloster and Kia Forte. But cars — particularly small ones — are having a tough time getting buyers to look their way as SUVs grow in popularity. Car sales are expected to hit a record low this year after steadily declining for several years. SUVs surpassed cars for the first time in 2016, and the gap only widens: Auto shopping site Edmunds.com forecasts the utilities will make up 43.5 percent of new vehicle sales this year, while cars will fall to 34.5 percent. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) The reasons are plenty, including relatively low gas prices, growing millennial families and small, attractive SUV models that are becoming more fuel efficient and affordable. The small car slump and utility boom has spurred industry changes: Ford is converting a Michigan plant that currently makes the Focus for Bronco SUV production. The automaker plans to move Focus production to China. So why the big push to make — and market — cars as the demand dwindles? There are economies of scale, since many cars are sold globally, including in overseas markets where small cars are more popular. Then there's the ""gateway"" effect, according to Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car buying site Autotrader.com. ""A small car is likely the first new vehicle a young person buys,"" she said in an email. ""So it is particularly important to make a good impression so that person sticks with a brand and moves up the size and price ladder."" Despite the sales drops, the U.S. small car category is still ""huge,"" Krebs said, representing 2.1 million last year and the fourth largest vehicle segment. Still, there's no question that several car-dependent manufacturers have been hurt by the shift to SUVs, including VW, Hyundai and Kia. The models being showcased in Detroit are examples of ""what they have to work with while they develop more sport-utilities,"" Krebs said. Hyundai isn't giving up on small cars, as evidenced by the new Veloster. It also recently revealed the updated Accent subcompact, which has some surprising optional features like remote start, which lets the driver start the car with a smartphone, and a hands-free trunk that opens when the driver waves a foot under it. ""We still believe there's big demand for basic transportation that offers more,"" said Michael O'Brien, who leads U.S. product planning for Kia, Hyundai's smaller affiliate. Underscoring the point, Kia said the Forte had its best sales year in 2017 — the last year before the redesigned model debuted at the Detroit show. Even though small cars have fallen out of favor in the U.S. now, automakers still need to invest in them due to demand in other parts of the world, says Mark Reuss, General Motors' global product development chief. Also, Reuss says he's seen events that have rapidly shifted what consumers want, and he wants to be ready if that happens. ""These are long-term capital investments,"" Reuss said. ""Some of the big shocks that have happened that I've seen in my career flip things pretty quick, faster than we can change capital investments."" Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, says customers looking for an affordable vehicle last year were more likely to shop for used SUVs over new small cars. But small cars are still an important part of the market, he says, especially in cities where people need something small and maneuverable. Sales of new small cars also spiked after the hurricanes in Florida and Texas, when people who needed transportation quickly went for the most affordable cars they could find. ""There's a place for the compact car,"" he said. ""There's a place for value."" ___ AP auto writers Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin contributed to this story. ___ Follow Jeff Karoub on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffkaroub.

110,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Hyundai plans to invest more than $350 million to build a plant in Alabama and also update an existing one there, officials said Tuesday.

124,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful even within the traditional confines of a State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump inflated the impact of his tax cuts Tuesday night, declared an end to a ""war"" on energy that did not exist when he took office and displayed a faulty grasp of immigration policy. A look at some of the statements in his speech and how they compare with the facts: TRUMP: ""We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history."" THE FACTS: No truer now than in the countless other times he has said the same. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ TRUMP: ""After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" THE FACTS: Actually, they are not rising any faster than they have before. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in 2017, slightly slower than the 2.9 percent increase recorded in 2016 under President Barack Obama. Most economists say that wages should increase at a faster rate as the unemployment rate drops. The unemployment rate stands at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that has done little so far to spark rising wages. The last time unemployment was this low, in the late 1990s, average hourly pay was rising at a 4 percent pace. ____ TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: That's a highly misleading characterization. The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Barack Obama's, making accusations of a war on energy hard to sustain. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that: The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the last decade. ___ TRUMP: ""We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money."" THE FACTS: Few economists think average incomes will jump by $4,000 simply because companies are paying less in taxes. The figure cited by Trump comes from his chief economist, Kevin Hassett. Many mainstream economists poked wide holes into this claim, including the author of one of the research papers cited by Hassett. Economists generally say most of the savings from lower corporate taxes would flow to investors, rather than workers. The problem with the $4,000 claim is that Trump is essentially promising $500 billion in income gains across the entire economy from tax cuts that are a small fraction of that total on an annual basis. ___ TRUMP: ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker."" THE FACTS: This appears to be true, but may not be as impressive as it sounds. According to a tally of public announcements by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that supported the tax law, about 3 million workers have gotten bonuses, raises or larger payments to their retirement accounts since the tax law was signed. That's about 2 percent of the more than 154 million Americans with jobs. The Labor Department said before the tax package was signed into law that 38 percent of workers would probably get some form of bonus in 2017. Few companies have yet granted across-the-board pay raises, which Trump and GOP leaders promised would result from the cut in corporate tax rates included in the overhaul. Many, such as Walmart and BB&T Bank, said they will raise their minimum wages. Walmart made similar announcements in 2015 and 2016. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. It's a far cry from what Trump and the GOP-led Congress set out to do last year, which was to scrap most of the sweeping Obama-era health law and replace it with a Republican alternative. The GOP blueprint would have left millions more Americans uninsured, making it even more unpopular than ""Obamacare.""

Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Obama's. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that. The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under George W. Bush and Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the past decade. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. ___ TRUMP: ""We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons."" THE FACTS: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in speeches this past week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ""and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members."" On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ""our partners in Central America."" That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. ___ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on beautiful clean coal."" THE FACTS: Coal is not clean. According to the Energy Department, more than 83 percent of all major air pollutants — sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, toxic mercury and dangerous soot particles — from power plants are from coal, even though coal makes up only 43 percent of the power generation. Power plants are the No. 1 source of those pollutants. Coal produces nearly twice as much heat-trapping carbon dioxide per energy created as natural gas, the department says. In 2011, coal burning emitted more than 6 million tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides versus 430,000 tons from other energy sources combined. ___ Associated Press writers Hope Yen, Josh Boak, Matthew Daly, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Eric Tucker, Seth Borenstein and Elliot Spagat contributed to this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck EDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures",5159,5165,Auto Brand,96
147,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful even within the traditional confines of a State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump inflated the impact of his tax cuts Tuesday night, declared an end to a ""war"" on energy that did not exist when he took office and displayed a faulty grasp of immigration policy. A look at some of the statements in his speech and how they compare with the facts: TRUMP: ""We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history."" THE FACTS: No truer now than in the countless other times he has said the same. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ TRUMP: ""After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" THE FACTS: Actually, they are not rising any faster than they have before. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in 2017, slightly slower than the 2.9 percent increase recorded in 2016 under President Barack Obama. Most economists say that wages should increase at a faster rate as the unemployment rate drops. The unemployment rate stands at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that has done little so far to spark rising wages. The last time unemployment was this low, in the late 1990s, average hourly pay was rising at a 4 percent pace. ____ TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: That's a highly misleading characterization. The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Barack Obama's, making accusations of a war on energy hard to sustain. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W.

Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the last decade. ___ TRUMP: ""We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money."" THE FACTS: Few economists think average incomes will jump by $4,000 simply because companies are paying less in taxes. The figure cited by Trump comes from his chief economist, Kevin Hassett. Many mainstream economists poked wide holes into this claim, including the author of one of the research papers cited by Hassett. Economists generally say most of the savings from lower corporate taxes would flow to investors, rather than workers. The problem with the $4,000 claim is that Trump is essentially promising $500 billion in income gains across the entire economy from tax cuts that are a small fraction of that total on an annual basis. ___ TRUMP: ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker."" THE FACTS: This appears to be true, but may not be as impressive as it sounds. According to a tally of public announcements by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that supported the tax law, about 3 million workers have gotten bonuses, raises or larger payments to their retirement accounts since the tax law was signed. That's about 2 percent of the more than 154 million Americans with jobs. The Labor Department said before the tax package was signed into law that 38 percent of workers would probably get some form of bonus in 2017. Few companies have yet granted across-the-board pay raises, which Trump and GOP leaders promised would result from the cut in corporate tax rates included in the overhaul. Many, such as Walmart and BB&T Bank, said they will raise their minimum wages. Walmart made similar announcements in 2015 and 2016. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011.

Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. It's a far cry from what Trump and the GOP-led Congress set out to do last year, which was to scrap most of the sweeping Obama-era health law and replace it with a Republican alternative. The GOP blueprint would have left millions more Americans uninsured, making it even more unpopular than ""Obamacare.""

The gains built on a powerful rally the day before that gave the market its biggest gain in more than two years. The market is still in the process of clawing back the huge losses it sustained last week. Technology companies and banks contributed the most to the market's upturn. Apple rose 1 percent and JPMorgan Chase increased 1.1 percent. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE American consumers' confidence slips WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers' confidence has slipped after reaching an 18-year high last month. The Conference Board says its consumer confidence index fell to 127.7 in March. That was down from 130 in February, which was the highest level since November 2000. Consumers were less optimistic in March as their assessment of business conditions declined. Their short-term expectations — including their outlook for the stock market — also declined, although overall expectations remain favorable. The business research group's index measures consumers' assessment of current conditions and their outlook for the next six months. They feel better about today's economy than they have since March 2001. Their outlook also improved. HOME PRICES Home prices post another big gain WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices posted another big gain in January, pushed higher by a shortage of homes for sale. Standard & Poor's says its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index climbed 6.2 percent in January from a year earlier. That nearly matches December's 6.3 percent gain, which had been the fastest 12-month growth in nearly three years. The price of houses is easily outpacing wage growth and inflation. Prices rose 12.9 percent in Seattle, 11.1 percent in Las Vegas and 10.2 percent in San Francisco. Chicago and Washington D.C. posted the weakest annual home-prices gains: 2.4 percent. Homes for sale are scarce. It would take just 3.4 months to snap up the supply of available homes at the current sales rate, down from an average since 2000 of 6 months. FACEBOOK PRIVACY SCANDAL Zuckerberg declines to talk to British parliamentary panel LONDON (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is snubbing a summons from a British Parliamentary committee investigating the rise of fake news, offering to send senior executives in his place. Damian Collins, chairman of Parliament's media committee, today urged Zuckerberg to ""think again"" about choosing not to appear and repeated an offer to have him testify via video link. Facebook has offered to send chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer or chief product officer Chris Cox. Zuckerberg is also under pressure to appear before U.S. Congress following allegations that consultants Cambridge Analytica harvested details of 50 million Facebook users and used the material in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election.

The Sparks, Maryland company will also us the tax cut to make investments, pay debt and benefit shareholders. Many companies have announced one-time bonuses, with some also announcing wage increases, following the changes in the tax code. Others include Home Depot, Disney, Starbucks, and Walmart. SOUTH KOREA-US-TRADE South Korean auto unions say changes to free trade deal would keep South Korean companies from entering US pickup market SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Unions at South Korea's two-largest automakers, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, say plans to revise a free trade deal with the United States involve concessions that will prevent local automakers from entering the fast-growing U.S. pick-up truck market. Hyundai's labor union said Tuesday that South Korea's government gave in to U.S. President Donald Trump at a time when the American market represents big opportunities. Kia's labor union said it shares that view. Hyundai said in a statement that it hoped the two governments would work together to defuse trade tensions. South Korea and the U.S. agreed to push back the earlier agreed-to elimination of import tariffs on pick-up trucks by 20 years to 2041. Hyundai has not yet begun commercial manufacturing of pick-ups but plans to in the future. WAYMO-JAGUAR Waymo to buy up to 20,000 vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover NEW YORK (AP) — Self-driving car pioneer Waymo will buy up to 20,000 electric vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover to help realize its vision for a robotic ride-hailing service. The commitment announced Tuesday marks another step in Waymo's evolution from a secret project started in Google nine years ago to a spin-off that's gearing up for an audacious attempt to reshape the transportation business. The Jaguar deal will expand upon a fleet of self-driving cars that Waymo has been gradually building in partnership with Fiat Chrysler since 2015. The minivans will be part of a ride-hailing service that Waymo plans to launch in Arizona later this year. Jaguar will deliver its vehicles for Waymo's ride-hailing from 2020 to 2022. Waymo says the 20,000 ""I-Pace"" models will provide up to 1 million rides per day.

CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS Robots break new ground in construction industry SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Robots are coming to a construction site near you. Tech startups are developing self-driving bulldozers, survey drones and bricklaying robots to help the construction industry boost productivity, speed and safety as it struggles to find enough skilled workers. A wave of automation is  transforming the construction industry, which has lagged behind other sectors in technological innovation. Backed by venture capital, tech startups are developing robots, drones, software and other technologies to help the construction industry to boost speed, safety and productivity. Autonomous machines are changing the nature of construction work in an industry that's facing a backlog of building projects. Workers at Berich Masonry in Englewood, Colorado, recently spent several weeks learning how to operate a bricklaying robot known as SAM. That's short for Semi-Automated Mason, a $400,000 machine which is made by Victor, New York-based Construction Robotics. The machine can lay about 3,000 bricks in an eight-hour shift - several times more than a mason working by hand. EU--BREXIT Lawmakers say UK should consider postponing Brexit LONDON (AP) — A key committee of British lawmakers says the U.K. should consider postponing Brexit because there may not be enough time to strike a deal with the European Union before Britain leaves the bloc a year from now. The Exiting the EU Committee says if major aspects of the future relationship remain unsettled by October, Britain should seek a ""limited extension"" of its EU membership. Britain and the EU want to seal a deal on their future relations by the fall, so national parliaments can approve it before Britain's official exit day: March 29, 2019. In a report published Sunday, the lawmakers say a proposed transition period of about two years should also be capable of being extended. Seven pro-Brexit lawmakers on the 21-member, all-party committee refused to back the report. CHINA-POLITICS Chinese Premier Li Keqiang appointed to second 5-year term BEIJING (AP) — China's ceremonial legislature has appointed the No. 2 Communist Party leader, Li Keqiang, to a second five-year term as premier and approved the appointment of a director for a national anti-corruption agency. Delegates to the National People's Congress on Sunday voted 2,964 to 2 to approve Li's appointment. The vote comes a day after party leader Xi Jinping was reappointed China's president with no limits on how many terms he can serve. The premier traditionally is China's top economic official but Xi has stripped Li of many of the post's most prominent duties by appointing himself to lead party bodies that oversee economic reform and state industry. The legislature also approved the appointment of a director for the National Supervisory Commission. CHINA-ECONOMY CZAR China's next economic czar: Harvard-trained Xi adviser BEIJING (AP) — China's next economy czar is a Harvard-trained supporter of free markets who is President Xi Jinping's top adviser. But he has no experience fighting the bureaucratic battles the post can require. Liu He's rise comes as the ruling Communist Party faces mounting pressure to make its cooling, state-dominated economy more productive. That will require politically fraught changes to open industries wider to private and foreign competition. The 66-year-old Liu was Monday named one of four vice premiers by China's ceremonial legislature. No details of his duties were immediately announced but he is widely expected to have broad economic powers. As a vice premier, Liu would answer to Premier Li Keqiang, whose post traditionally is top economic official. But Xi has stripped Li of many of his job's most prominent duties. JAPAN-TRADE Japan's February exports, imports grow amid trade war fears TOKYO (AP) — Japan's exports in February grew 1.8 percent compared to the same month a year ago, according to Ministry of Finance data released Monday. Worries are growing about a possible trade war over President Donald Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. Japan is asking for an exemption. Exports are expected to grow in coming months, boosted by global economic growth. Japan exports much of its steel to Asia and not the U.S. Exports grew to 6.46 trillion yen ($61 billion). Japan's imports in February grew 16.5 percent on year also to 6.46 trillion yen ($61 billion), when rounded off, leaving a surplus of 3.4 billion yen ($32 million), the ministry said. By country, Japan's exports to the U.S. in February grew 4.3 percent. AIR BAG FAILURES US probes 4 deaths in Hyundai-Kia cars when air bags failed DETROIT (AP) — Air bags in some Hyundai and Kia cars failed to inflate in crashes and four people are dead. Now the U.S. government's road safety agency wants to know why. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it's investigating problems that affect an estimated 425,000 cars made by the Korean automakers. The agency also is looking into whether the same problem could happen in vehicles made by other companies. The agency says the probe covers 2011 Hyundai Sonatas and 2012 and 2013 Kia Fortes. The agency has reports of six front-end crashes with significant damage. Six other people were injured. The problem has been traced to electrical circuit shorts in air bag control computers made by parts supplier ZF-TRW. NHTSA will investigate whether other automakers used the same computer. NYC HELICOPTER CRASH Senators want to know how FAA approved open-door flights NEW YORK (AP) — A deadly helicopter crash has prompted New York's senators to call for an investigation into how the Federal Aviation Administration ever approved open-door helicopter sightseeing flights and tight harness systems. Democratic U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand (KEER'-sten JIHL'-uh-brand) made the demand in a joint letter on Sunday to the Department of Transportation's inspector general. They say ""clearly something went remarkably wrong"" with the FAA's approval process that allowed helicopters that fly with their doors open, often so passengers can take pictures, and use harnesses that can't be quickly released. On Friday, the FAA temporarily grounded open-door flights and the use of tight seat restraints. The ban came amid concerns such harnesses prevented passengers from escaping when their helicopter plunged into the East River last Sunday, killing five people.

219,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking leverage in immigration talks, President Donald Trump overstated the impact of a March 5 deadline after which he suggests a program protecting thousands of young immigrants from deportation would end. In fact, a recent court ruling has rendered that deadline basically meaningless. The president also made a puzzling plain-as-day exaggeration about the size of the TV audience that tuned in for his big speech to Congress last week. It capped another week of Trump statements — many of them made during his State of the Union address — that strained credulity, on immigration, energy, crime, health care and more. A look at some of the questionable claims: TRUMP: ""March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!"" — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: Not so fast. A recent court ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration's plan to end the program has left the March 5 deadline all but moot for now. The deadline dates back to Sept. 5, when Trump announced that he was ending the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provided protection from deportation and work permits for about 800,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. as children and are now living here illegally. To lessen the blow, the administration announced that recipients whose status was set to expire before March 5 would be allowed to apply for renewals, so long as their applications were received within a month. Trump framed that as giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. But that timeline became far less significant when a federal court judge in San Francisco blocked Trump's action, saying young immigrants would suffer ""irreparable harm."" In response, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it was once again accepting DACA renewals, processing them just as they had before Trump's September announcement — including renewals for applicants whose permits expire after March 5. The judge's order to accept DACA renewals will remain in effect at least until the Supreme Court rules definitively. Trump is using the March 5 deadline as pressure for Democrats to come to the table, while Democrats will probably spend the next month arguing that a failure to act leaves DACA recipients vulnerable and living in fear. But without a looming deadline, it seems doubtful there would be the same urgency to get something done. ___ TRUMP: ""Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history."" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Not the highest in history. Trump's TV viewership as measured by Nielsen (45.6 million, as he said) trailed that for first State of the Union speeches by Barack Obama (48 million), George W. Bush (51.7 million) and Bill Clinton (46.8 million). Trump also got more TV viewers in his first speech to Congress a year ago (47.7 million) than in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. There is no reliable measure for how many people watched Tuesday on their computers or phones, a slice of viewership that is not counted by Nielsen. But Trump was not factoring in those viewers in his false claim. He cited the Nielsen number only. ___ TRUMP: ""We've signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."" — remarks Thursday to Republican lawmakers' retreat. THE FACTS: No. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. He made the same claim Tuesday night and countless times before that. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, Trump's plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the past five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: What war? Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Obama's. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that. The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under George W. Bush and Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the past decade. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance ",7406,7412,Auto Brand,101

317,"Most car shoppers know that a used car can be a fantastic value. In the long run, a used car will usually cost less than a new one, and it will virtually always be cheaper than leasing a car every three years. As practical as it is to buy a used car, it can also present an opportunity to get a little fancy. This is where ""cousin cars"" come in. Cousin cars are vehicles that are produced by one parent company and offered in two versions: one for the luxury buyers and the other for the masses. But because luxury vehicles tend to depreciate more quickly than everyday cars, the price difference often narrows as the cars age. The upshot is that if you shop for an upscale used cousin car, it is often possible to get it for a price that's close to that of its more mundane relation. Some cousin car pairings include the workaday and the luxurious , the fuel-efficient and the sporty , and the commodious and the fully appointed . Here are a few examples across different car segments. These are based on average transaction prices for the year, make and model discussed. They do not represent any particular trim level: SEDANS: and In 2012, the average transaction price for a new Lincoln MKZ was roughly $37,024. That's about $11,600 more than the average price of its mass-market cousin, the 2012 Ford Fusion, which had an average sale price of $25,427. The average sale price of a used 2012 MKZ is now $12,887 compared to $9,939 for a 2012 Fusion, narrowing the difference to about $2,900. If you opt to buy an MKZ for that extra $2,900, you'll get a plusher cabin, fancier styling, heated and cooled leather seats with memory function, and a long list of other standard features. and If you were considering both the ES 350 and the Camry as new cars six years ago, you would have had to decide if the Lexus, which had an average transaction price of $38,415, was worth paying $14,000 more than the well-equipped but less opulent Camry. The Camry's average sale price was $24,306 in the same time frame. If you shop for them as used cars now, you'll find the ES 350 will have an average sale price of $17,775, only about $5,500 more than the average used car price of a 2012 Camry, which is $12,285. The ES 350 has upgraded features such as smart-key access, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, larger wheels and tires, the option of parking assist, and a quieter, more refined ride quality. MIDSIZE SUV: and The 2013 Lexus GX is a midsize SUV that has all the features you'd expect in a high-end vehicle. But its standard V8 engine, off-road prowess and 6,500-pound towing capability set it apart from luxury crossovers that wouldn't dare to cross a stream. Its utility reflects its kinship to the Toyota 4Runner: They share a fair amount of automotive DNA. In 2013, the GX had an average transaction price of $57,181 compared to $36,704 for the 2013 4Runner, for a $20,477 difference. As used vehicles, the average price for a 2103 GX is about $29,509. A used 2013 4Runner will have an average sale price of $25,245. That difference is only about $4,300. If you pony up the extra money for the GX, you would get a well-appointed interior that includes heated and cooled leather seats, a moonroof and a power-folding third-row seat. The Lexus also has a more premium feel and an upscale exterior to match. LARGE SUV: and A new 2013 Escalade had an average price of $71,747. The average sale price of its cousin, the 2013 GMC Yukon, was $55,041, for a $16,706 difference. Fast-forward to 2018, and the price average price of a used 2013 Escalade is $35,871, compared to $31,346 for a 2013 Yukon, a difference of about $4,500. The extra charge for the Escalade gets you an engine that's larger and more powerful than the engines found in the Yukon line (with the exception of the Yukon Denali). You'll also get a flashier exterior, standard navigation, a Bose stereo system, and a slew of other luxury upgrades. When you're shopping cousin cars, remember that the luxury option could come with additional long-term costs, such as a higher insurance rate and more expensive parts and service. It might also require premium fuel, which can cost up to 50 cents more per gallon. To help you shop, here are the standard car brands and their luxury cousins: — Honda and Acura — Volkswagen and Audi — Ford and Lincoln — Hyundai and Genesis — Nissan and Infiniti — Toyota and Lexus When it comes to General Motors, the vehicle hierarchy isn't always quite as clear. The GM family includes Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. Several vehicles share platforms across the brand names with varying degrees of upgrades. As a rule, Chevrolet is the entry point. Buick and GMC are more upscale. Cadillac is strictly luxury. EDMUNDS SAYS: If you're a savvy shopper, you might be able to get a great deal on a used luxury vehicle for not much more than the price of its more humble cousin. Being practical doesn't mean you can't pamper yourself. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

346,"GENEVA (AP) — Global automakers are rolling out more electric vehicles at the Geneva International Motor Show as they try to challenge Tesla and get ahead of a disruptive shift in transportation toward lower-emission and autonomous vehicles. For the European carmakers, the mood at the event could be unsettled by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat this weekend to slap tariffs on the region's manufacturers in a potential trade war. And the three big German manufacturers — Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW — will grasp the opportunity to highlight their high-tech creations amid their continued trouble with diesel technology, such as the legal attempts to ban diesel in German cities and the scandal over exposing monkeys to exhaust in lab tests. The carmakers will show off their wares during press days Monday evening through Wednesday; the show opens to the public Thursday and runs through March 18. Here are the top themes. ___ ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS The biggest trend in autos is the race to make new technologies affordable and functional. Some of the vehicles on show — such as Volkswagen's autonomous and battery-driven I.D. Vizzion — will be concepts not yet ready for production. Others will have vehicles that are ready to go on sale in coming months, such as Jaguar Land Rover with the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-driven SUV advertising 310 miles (498 kilometers) of range and rapid-charging capability. Mercedes-Benz will have an addition to its EQ electric brand. Hyundai will show its Kona Electric, with either a 300-kilometer (186-mile) or 470-kilometer (292-mile) range. Luxury carmakers like BMW and Jaguar are eager to grab back some of the sales of high-end vehicles taken by Tesla with its electric Model S high-performance sedan and Model X SUV. When it comes to technological change there will be more than vehicles to talk about. The German automakers and Ford are working to build a network of fast-charging stations across Europe through their joint venture, Ionity. The idea is to make electric vehicles more appealing by enabling longer trips. Currently, many electric models are charged over several hours at home at night and used for short commutes, limiting their use. Ionity's 350 kilowatt-per-hour charging capacity could cut charge times to 15 minutes or less. Automakers are under pressure to come up with vehicles propelled by something other than internal combustion engines to comply with government efforts to reduce air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for global warming. The issue became even more pressing after a German court said last week that polluted cities can ban older-model diesels. Diesel sales had already slipped after Volkswagen's 2015 scandal over cheating on emissions tests. Autonomous vehicles could herald a shift to transportation as a service with less incentive to own a car. Analysts at IHS Markit estimate that autonomous cars will have their first significant sales volume with 51,000 units in 2021 and surpass 33 million per year by 2040. ___ MONKEY BUSINESS All three German auto makers have condemned the 2014 experiment in which Volkswagen had macaque monkeys exposed to diesel exhaust at a lab in New Mexico. The tests were commissioned through a now-disbanded organization whose board had representatives from BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler. They have said they're investigating how the tests happened. The show won't erase public indignation or media questions but at least offers a chance to talk about something other than a PR disaster. ___ SEEN THAT ALREADY Some of the more important vehicles at the show have already been revealed as companies use stand-alone events to show off their new cars rather than putting them on display in a crowd of other vehicles. That's the case with Mercedes-Benz A-Class, its small entry model hatchback that was unveiled Feb. 2 in Amsterdam. The car features voice-activated control of navigation, phone, music and heating and air conditioning somewhat like Amazon and Google's devices for home use. The Jaguar I-Pace had a digital unveiling from Graz, Austria on Thursday ahead of the show — showing it beating two Tesla models in a race. ___ IF YOU HAVE TO ASK HOW MUCH Geneva is typically a place to show off gorgeous, extremely fast and very, very expensive vehicles. A taste: Luxury sports car maker McLaren offers the low-slung Senna, named after the race driver Ayrton Senna. Its 800 horsepower turbocharged V8 engine takes it to a top speed of 340 kph (211 mph).  Just 500 of the sleek, carbon-fiber vehicles will be built, hand-assembled at the company's production center in Woking, Surrey, England. The price:  750,000 pounds including tax, which translates to $1.03 million at today's exchange rate. Want one? Sorry. The company says it has buyers for all of them.",1477,1483,Auto Brand,106

372,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Japanese automakers Toyota and Mazda on Wednesday announced plans to build a huge $1.6 billion joint-venture plant in Alabama that will eventually employ about 4,000 people. Several states had competed for the coveted project, which will be able to turn out 300,000 vehicles per year and will produce the Toyota Corolla compact car for North America and a new small SUV from Mazda. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and company executives held a joint news conference to announce that the facility is coming to the Huntsville area not far from the Tennessee line. Production is expected to begin by 2021. ""This is indeed a great day in Alabama,"" Ivey said. ""Thank you for believing in the potential of our people in the great state of Alabama. ... Toyota and Mazda, thank you so much. Welcome to sweet home Alabama."" To lure the plant, the state offered an incentive package of $370 million in tax abatements and investment rebates, Alabama Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said. That figure does not include a local incentive package still being finalized. The state will also provide workforce training. Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motors, said the new facility is something of a homecoming since the company already has one plant in the state. The new Huntsville plant will be just 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Alabama, which produces four-cylinder, V-6 and V-8 engines for several Toyota models. The decision to pick Alabama is another example of foreign-based automakers building U.S. factories in the South. To entice manufacturers, Southern states have used a combination of lucrative incentive packages, low-cost labor and a pro-business labor environment since the United Auto Workers union is stronger in Northern states. North Carolina apparently was a finalist in the running for the huge factory but remains one of the few Southeast states not to land a modern carmaker. Alabama was tied with Tennessee as the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in the country last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The state produced 9 percent of the cars made in the U.S., the center said. ""Alabama won a first place trophy today in being selected for that plant,"" said Dave Sullivan, product analysis manager at AutoPacific Inc., an automotive research company. Sullivan said the factory itself is a huge asset for the state, but it will also cause economic ripples by bringing spinoff jobs at suppliers and service companies in the area. U.S. sales of small cars fell nearly 10 percent last year as buyers continued a massive shift toward SUVs and pickup trucks. Corolla sales fell 14 percent for the year, to just less than 309,000, according to Autodata Corp. Still, Toyota and Mazda have said their collaboration will respect mutual independence and equality. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, already provides hybrid technology to Mazda, which makes compact cars for Toyota at its Mexico plant. The sheer cost of the plant also makes a partnership logical, as it boosts cost-efficiency and economies of scale. Working together on green and other auto technology also makes sense as the segment becomes increasingly competitive because of concerns about global warming, the environment and safety. Alabama started on the road to becoming an auto manufacturing hub in 1993 when Mercedes chose it as the location for a manufacturing plant after the state offered a then-eye popping $250 million incentive package. Honda and Toyota followed by putting engine plants in the state. In 2002, Hyundai announced an assembly facility in Montgomery. ____ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed to this story from Detroit, Michigan.",3646,3652,Auto Brand,108

On Monday, Arizona's governor suspended Uber's self-driving vehicle testing privileges after one of its autonomous vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian last week. But auto engineers and industry analysts still say roads will become safer as more vehicles get automated features that either assist or replace human drivers. The government says 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error. The cutting-edge devices usually come out first in more expensive vehicles, but go to mainstream vehicles as costs fall. Here are five new safety devices that are showing up in vehicles: STAY FOCUSED: A company called NVIDIA is using artificial intelligence and cameras to sense where a driver is looking and focus sensors everywhere else. If a pedestrian or another vehicle appears  where the driver isn't looking, the system will intervene, either sounding a warning or by stopping the car from moving, says Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive business for the Santa Clara, California, company. ""Before we get to full automation, if the driver is still in control and responsible, we want to know when we should provide alerts and when we should not,"" Shapiro says. NVIDIA has a contract with Volkswagen to deploy the system in the next two years. Other automakers are likely to follow. LOOKING BACKWARD: When a driver activates a turn signal, an 8-inch screen behind the steering wheel on Hyundai's new Nexo hydrogen fuel cell vehicle shows everything on that side of the car plus what's directly behind it. The system uses existing cameras to let drivers see without turning their heads. ""The information we can offer from a camera may be better than a live look over the shoulder,"" says Cason Grover, senior manager of vehicle technology planning for Hyundai. Other cars have similar technology but most don't have as wide of a view. SEEING SIGNS: Mercedes' new S-Class cars have advanced navigation and global mapping, and cameras that read speed limit signs. These enable the car's computers to warn drivers of the speed limit or keep them from exceeding it. The system also recognizes upcoming construction zones, curves or roundabouts, and can slow the car ahead of when a driver would. Volvo has a similar system that reads speed signs, including those in school zones. LASER GUIDED: Smaller versions of those spinning 360-degree mechanical laser sensors that sit atop self-driving cars are coming to mainstream vehicles. The lasers, called Lidar for Light Detection and Ranging, can see far-off objects in the dark, in bad weather, and in great detail. Audi plans to introduce a front-facing laser in the grille of the A8 sedan this fall as part of a limited self-driving system that takes control of the vehicle in freeway traffic jams below 37 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour). Spokesman Mark Dahncke says Audi is still working to consolidate Lidar with radar and cameras as it steps from human control to limited automated driving. Audi's system is the first step toward more widespread use of Lidar. Parts supplier Continental is working on a fully electronic version for an unspecified automaker that can see smaller objects such as bicycles and pedestrians in three dimensions, 200 meters (656 feet) ahead. Currently Continental sells a Lidar system that spots only vehicles and can see only 10 meters (33 feet) forward. The longer-range system integrated into the car's body is the missing link in the march toward autonomous vehicles, says Arnaud Lagandré, a Continental vice president. ""You can see through fog, you can see through rain, you can see through the water splash from the car in front of you."" TRAFFIC LIGHT TIMING: For more than a year, some Audi A4 cars and Q7 SUVs in Las Vegas have been linked to traffic light computers. They get a dashboard countdown telling them when lights will change. This can prevent drivers from running lights and can let them time their travel to avoid stopping. It's the forerunner to vehicle-to-infrastructure communications that will keep cars moving and could warn drivers that a car is about to run a red light. Audi is testing in several other cities. About 600 city traffic lights in Washington, D.C., were just added.",2093,2099,Auto Brand,110
421,"DETROIT (AP) — After leaving a leadership post at Google's autonomous car unit, Chris Urmson and two other self-driving vehicle pioneers are back in the race with a new company that will rival their former employers. Aurora Innovation on Thursday announced that it had signed partnerships with Hyundai and Volkswagen to help the automakers develop autonomous vehicles, a major step in the tightening competition. Urmson, who led autonomous vehicle development efforts at Alphabet Inc.'s Google for more than seven years, started Aurora last year with former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell. He talked about the partnerships, how to make money on autonomous vehicles and when we all might be riding in them in an interview with The Associated Press. Responses have been edited for length and clarity: Q: How will you make money on the Hyundai and VW deals?  Will you sell them your self-driving system or are these broader partnerships? A: We did not disclose financial terms on these. But I can tell you that we're a for-profit company. We will work out long-term arrangements and share them when ready.  We're going to focus on the fully autonomous space, where the occupant will be free to use their time in the vehicle how they want to. Q: Other companies and many analysts have said the big money to be made in autonomous cars is providing transportation as a service, and that the vehicles and self-driving technology could become lower-profit commodities. Will Aurora be part of providing a ride service? A: One of the first applications is providing transportation for people in self-driven vehicles. It'll deliver safety benefits. It'll deliver improved access to mobility. It will improve the quality of life in cities. The way the economics play out over time is still far from foregone, combining self-driving capability, a vehicle and a (ride-sharing) network. We still don't know which of those pieces will be dominant or if they will find a happy equilibrium. Q: When do you see autonomous vehicles in widespread use? At Google you said a company goal was to have them in place so your son didn't have to get a driver's license when he turns 16 in 2019. A:  Widespread use, no. I don't think that's going to be the case. But I do believe you will probably see places where he could get around without driving. We're starting to see interesting things happen in Arizona (Google's Waymo autonomous car unit this year, for instance, will begin a test carrying passengers in self-driving minivans without a human backup driver in the Phoenix area). We'll see how the rollouts happen and how quickly we can get the technology to scale. Q: Is the technology moving toward public use faster than you had expected? A: Two or three years ago the level of investment in the space was nowhere near what it is today. The overall velocity of the field has increased dramatically. There are more people working on it. It's a very hard problem. I think we're learning more about how hard the problem is. Q: What's standing in the way? A: One is getting the technology so it deals with those hard problems of driving, dealing with these rare events where the system gets pushed to really have to perform well. Second is actually manufacturing and bringing it to market at scale. We think we can go and tackle that first problem. We know how to bring the right technology to bear, how to build the right self-driving system. Then we partner with automotive companies. For the most part the folks that are working here believe in the social good of this technology. One and a quarter million people dying on the world's roads, you don't address that by having five cars in a test fleet.",294,300,Auto Brand,111

556,"DETROIT (AP) — Air bags in some Hyundai and Kia cars failed to inflate in crashes and four people are dead. Now the U.S. government's road safety agency wants to know why. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it's investigating problems that affect an estimated 425,000 cars made by the Korean automakers. The agency also is looking into whether the same problem could happen in vehicles made by other companies. , the safety agency says the probe covers 2011 Hyundai Sonata midsize cars and 2012 and 2013 Kia Forte compacts. The agency says it has reports of six front-end crashes with significant damage to the cars. Four people died and six were injured. The problem has been traced to electrical circuit shorts in air bag control computers made by parts supplier ZF-TRW. NHTSA now wants to know if other automakers used the same computer. On Feb. 27, Hyundai recalled nearly 155,000 Sonatas due to air bag failures, which the company blamed on the short circuits.  Hyundai's sister automaker Kia, which sells similar vehicles, has yet to issue a recall. In a statement Saturday, Kia said that it has not confirmed any air bag non-deployments in its 2002-2013 Kia Forte models arising from ""the potential chip issue."" The company said it will work with NHTSA investigators. ""Kia will act promptly to conduct a safety recall, if it determines that a recall would be appropriate,"" the company said. But a consumer complaint cited in NHTSA's investigation documents said Kia was informed of a crash near Oakland in which air bags failed to deploy and a passenger was killed. In October 2015, the complainant told NHTSA that a 2012 Forte was involved in a serious front-end crash that occurred in July 2013. A passenger was killed and the driver was injured. According to the complaint, Kia was notified, the air bag computer was tested and it was ""found not to be working."" People who complain to the NHTSA are not identified in its database. It was unclear whether the agency verified the complainant's statement. A message was left Saturday for agency spokeswomen. Kia spokesman James Bell said he could not comment beyond the company's statement. In addition, no deaths or injuries were disclosed in Hyundai's recall documents, which were posted by NHTSA in early March. Hyundai spokesman Jim Trainor says the problem occurred in rare high-speed head-on collisions that were offset from the center of the vehicles. ""It's very unusual to have that kind of collision,"" he said Saturday. Dealers will consider offering loaner cars to owners until the problem can be repaired, he said. ""We certainly would do everything we can to help our customers,"" Trainor said. Hyundai said in a statement that the air bag control circuitry was damaged in three crashes and a fourth crash is under investigation. ZF-TRW said in a statement that it is prevented by confidentiality agreements from identifying other automakers who bought its air bag control computers. The company said it is working with customers and supports the NHTSA investigation. According to NHTSA, Hyundai investigated and found the problem was ""electrical overstress"" in the computers. The company didn't have a fix developed at the time but said it was investigating the problem with ZF-TRW. Hyundai does not yet have a fix for the problem but said it expects the Sonata recall to start April 20. The problem also can stop the seat belts from tightening before a crash. In the documents, NHTSA said it understands that the Kia Fortes under investigation use similar air bag control computers made by ZF-TRW. The agency noted a 2016 recall involving more than 1.4 million Fiat Chrysler cars and SUVs that had a similar problem causing the air bags not to deploy. Agency documents show those vehicles had air bag computers made by ZF-TRW. The agency says it will evaluate the scope of Hyundai's recall, confirm Kia's use of the same or similar air bag control computers and look into the cause. It also will investigate whether ""any other vehicle manufacturers used the same or similar"" ZF-TRW computers and whether there have been any similar air bag failures. The agency says four crashes occurred in Sonatas and two happened in Fortes. One Forte crash happened in Canada. All six crashes were reported to NHTSA between 2012 and 2017, but it was unclear when they occurred. In May of last year, NHTSA opened an investigation into whether Hyundai and Kia moved quickly enough to recall more than 1.6 million cars and SUVs because the engines can stall, increasing the risk of a crash. The investigation into three recalls by the two brands is pending. The agency also said it's investigating whether the automakers followed safety reporting requirements.",32,38,Auto Brand,118

654,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. said Thursday its net profit for the second quarter fell 14 percent over a year earlier due to the South Korean won's strength against the U.S. dollar. South Korea's largest automaker said its April-June net income was 701 billion won ($626 million), compared with 817 billion won a year earlier. It was lower than the analyst consensus of 897 billion won, according to financial data provider FactSet. Sales inched up 2 percent over a year earlier to 24.7 trillion won ($22.1 billion) but operating profit sank 29 percent to 951 billion won ($849 million). Hyundai Motors's profit fell despite it having sold more vehicles. That is because its overseas profit repatriated to South Korea shrank due to the cheaper U.S. dollar. In April-June, car sales rose 11 percent over a year earlier to 1.2 million units. For the first half of this year, sales rose 4.5 percent to 2.2 million units. In the U.S. market, Hyundai's car sales fell sharply during the first six months of this year as new SUV models such as the Kona did not help sales until May, while demand for Hyundai's flagship sedans stayed weak. Sales in South Korea were helped by new SUV models. Hyundai's sales revived after sinking in China last year due to a diplomatic row over South Korea's deployment of a U.S. missile defense system. But Hyundai uncertainties related to the THAAD missile system remain since Chinese consumers have shunned Korean products. Going forward, Hyundai cited global trade tensions as a troubling source of uncertainty that could dent auto demand, if prolonged. If the U.S. government imposes tariffs on foreign-made cars or components, car prices for consumers will jump, hurting the industry, Hyundai said.",26,32,Auto Brand,121

660,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. sales of new cars and trucks tailed off in February as automakers eased up on discounts. Sales fell 2 percent from last February to 1.3 million, according to Autodata Corp. Among major automakers, only Toyota, Subaru and Volkswagen reported sales gains over last February. Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said automakers spent an average of $65 less per vehicle on incentives in February compared to the same month last year. That's a stark contrast from 2017, when incentive spending often climbed $300 or $400 per month. LaNeve said discounts could grow during the spring and summer, when tax returns arrive and more people shop for vehicles. But based on the first two months of this year, he expects automakers to remain fairly disciplined. In the past, heavy discounting has led to overproduction and steep declines in automakers' profits. Here are some details regarding February sales: — General Motors Co. sales fell just under 7 percent to 220,905. Sales were dragged down by the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, GM's top-selling vehicle. Silverado sales were off more than 16 percent from a year ago, when the company had record February sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. GMC and Chevrolet sales were down for the month but Buick and Cadillac sales rose. — Ford Motor Co. sales also fell 7 percent to 194,132. Ford said its car and SUV sales were down but sales of the F-Series pickup — its biggest seller — inched up 3.5 percent. Ford brand sales were down 6 percent while luxury Lincoln sales plummeted 23 percent. — Toyota Motor Corp. sales rose 4.5 percent to 182,195 vehicles. Sales of its top-seller, the Camry sedan, jumped 12 percent as an updated version went on sale. Luxury Lexus sales also rose 5 percent. — Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 1 percent to 165,903. Jeep brand sales jumped 12 percent and Alfa Romeo sales were also up, but Ram truck sales fell 14 percent because of a drop in fleet buyers. Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat sales also fell on low consumer demand for cars. — Nissan Motor Co. sales fell 4 percent to 129,930. Demand for Nissan cars fell 17 percent but truck and SUV sales were up 9 percent, led by the Rogue small SUV. Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand saw sales fall 7 percent. — Honda Motor Co. sales fell 5 percent to 115,557. Sales of its best-seller, the CR-V SUV, dropped 19 percent despite a recent redesign. Luxury Acura sales were up 1 percent. — Hyundai Motor Co. sales fell 13 percent to 46,095 as higher sales of SUVs failed to make up for declining car sales. Genesis luxury sales also slid 14 percent. — Subaru brand sales rose 4 percent to 47,209. Sales of its newly redesigned Crosstrek SUV jumped 61 percent. — Volkswagen brand sales rose 6 percent to 26,660.

670,"DETROIT (AP) — Federal safety investigators have expanded probes into Hyundai and Kia engine failures to include complaints about fires in the automakers' vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in a letter to Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida that it has 402 fire complaints with and without collisions. Nelson and the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety had asked if the agency was investigating the fires. Deputy Administrator Heidi King told Nelson in a letter released Wednesday that the agency has included non-collision fires in the engine failure probes. She wrote that many who complained of engine failures also reported fires. In May of 2017 the government began investigating whether the automakers moved quickly enough to recall over 1.6 million vehicles because of engines stalling. Messages were left seeking comment from the automakers. Last year the companies said they were cooperating with the investigation. In a statement, Hyundai said if the company and NHTSA find that more repairs are needed for the vehicles, ""we will take action to ensure the safety of our customers."" The company said it has a robust system in place to monitor vehicle fires that includes reporting them to NHTSA as required. If the cause is a product issue, then Hyundai will do a recall as it has in the past, the statement said. A message was left Wednesday for a Kia spokesman. It wasn't clear how many fires happened without collisions. Nelson wrote King earlier this month saying that his staff had found at least 23 reports of spontaneous fires in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since 2014 in Florida alone. The Center for Auto Safety found 120 fire complaints that didn't involve crashes. Nelson cited news reports of drivers having to flee vehicles before they became engulfed in flames. ""I'm glad they're looking into these fires but they need to pick up the pace,"" Nelson said in a statement. He plans to ask NHTSA to brief lawmakers on the investigation timeline and whether they'll take further action. NHTSA is looking into three recalls by the related Korean brands, and it's also investigating whether the automakers followed safety reporting requirements. Hyundai recalled about 470,000 vehicles in September of 2015 because manufacturing debris can restrict oil flow to connecting rod bearings. That can cause bearings in four-cylinder engines to wear and fail. The repair is an expensive engine block replacement. In March of last year, the automakers issued two more recalls covering 1.2 million additional vehicles with the same engine problem. If the agency finds that the companies moved too slowly to recall vehicles, then it can issue fines or order additional recalls. NHTSA, in documents posted last year, said Hyundai limited vehicles in the 2015 recall to a group manufactured prior to April 12, 2012. The company said it solved the manufacturing problem after that date. Kia said at the time of the 2015 recall that its 2.4-liter and 2-liter ""Theta II"" engines that were the same design as Hyundai's were not recalled then because they didn't have the same issue. Then both companies issued more recalls 18 months later for the same problem, including models the automakers originally said weren't affected, investigators wrote in documents posted on the agency's website. The documents at the time didn't list any crashes or injuries. The recalls from last year cover some of the Korean automakers' most popular models in the U.S. and Canada, including 2013 and 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport SUVs and Sonata midsize cars. Also covered are Kia Optima midsize cars from 2011 through 2014, Kia Sportage SUVs from 2011 through 2013 and Kia Sorento SUVs from 2012 through 2014. Kia is a smaller affiliate of Hyundai.

734,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Japanese automakers Toyota and Mazda on Wednesday announced plans to build a mammoth $1.6 billion joint-venture plant in Alabama that will eventually employ about 4,000 people. Several states had competed for the coveted project, which will be able to turn out 300,000 vehicles per year and produce the Toyota Corolla compact car for North America and a new small SUV from Mazda. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and company executives held a joint news conference to announce that the facility is coming to the Huntsville area not far from the Tennessee line. Production is expected to begin by 2021. ""This is indeed a great day in Alabama,"" Ivey said. ""Thank you for believing in the potential of our people in the great state of Alabama. ... To Toyota and Mazda, thank you so much. Welcome to sweet home Alabama To lure the plant, the state offered an incentive package of $379 million in tax abatements, investment rebates and the construction of a worker training facility. Alabama Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said that figure does not include a local incentive package that is still being finalized. ""It is a great honor to announce that Toyota and Mazda will be building a new vehicle plant here. I'd like to express our sincere appreciation for the people of Alabama and Huntsville for their support,"" said Masamichi Kogai, CEO and president of Mazda Motor Corporation. Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motors, said the new facility is something of a homecoming since the company already has one plant in the state. The new Huntsville plant will be just 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Alabama, which produces four-cylinder, V-6 and V-8 engines for several Toyota models. The decision to pick Alabama is another example of foreign-based automakers building U.S. factories in the South. To entice manufacturers, Southern states have used a combination of lucrative incentive packages, low-cost labor and a pro-business labor environment since the United Auto Workers union is stronger in Northern states. Alabama was already tied with Tennessee as the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in the country last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The state produced 9 percent of the cars made in the U.S., the center said. ""Alabama won a first place trophy today in being selected for that plant,"" said Dave Sullivan, product analysis manager at AutoPacific Inc., an automotive research company. Sullivan said the factory itself is a huge asset for the state, but it will also cause economic ripples by bringing spinoff jobs at suppliers and service companies in the area. The announcement comes at a time that U.S. sales of small cars fell nearly 10 percent last year as buyers continued a massive shift toward SUVs and pickup trucks. Corolla sales fell 14 percent for the year, to just less than 309,000, according to Autodata Corp. Still, Toyota and Mazda have said their collaboration will respect mutual independence and equality. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, already provides hybrid technology to Mazda, which makes compact cars for Toyota at its Mexico plant. The sheer cost of the plant also makes a partnership logical, as it boosts cost-efficiency and economies of scale. Working together on green and other auto technology also makes sense as the segment becomes increasingly competitive because of concerns about global warming, the environment and safety. Alabama started on the road to becoming an auto manufacturing hub in 1993 when Mercedes chose it as the location for a manufacturing plant after the state offered a then-eye popping $250 million incentive package.

809,DETROIT (AP) — Federal safety investigators have expanded probes into Hyundai and Kia engine failures to include complaints about fires in the automakers' vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in a letter to Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida that it has 402 fire complaints with and without collisions. Nelson and the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety had asked if the agency was investigating the fires. Deputy Administrator Heidi King told Nelson in a letter that the agency has included non-collision fires in the engine failure probes. She wrote that many who complained of failures also reported fires. In May of 2017 the government began investigating whether the automakers moved quickly enough to recall over 1.6 million vehicles because of engines stalling.

836,"DETROIT (AP) — Neither higher gas prices nor rising interest rates could put a damper on U.S. auto sales during the first half of the year. Sales rose 1.8 percent during the first half of the year, while June sales were up about 5 percent compared with a year ago, according to Edmunds.com. Analysts said the boost was fueled by strong consumer confidence and low unemployment. But analysts at Cox Automotive, which includes Kelley Blue Book, issued a cautionary note on the numbers, saying that much of the increase was due to low-profit sales to fleet buyers such as rental car companies, and retail sales to individual buyers were propped up by rising incentives such as rebates and subsidized leases. Sales are ""defying gravity"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox. ""Retail sales have been flat, and even those sales have been supported by incentives being up 6 percent."" Cox analysts also said rising interest rates and a possible trade war due to tariff threats from President Donald Trump could raise new-vehicle prices and payments and cut into auto sales in the second half. Still, given the fact that automakers are willing to spend to keep their share of the market, Cox analysts raised their full-year forecast by 100,000 vehicles to 16.8 million vehicles. Trucks and SUVs accounted for 68 percent of the market in June, a record high as car sales continued to fade, Edmunds said. The Federal Reserve in mid-June raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time and signaled that it may step up the pace of rate increases. The central bank raised its key short-term rate by a modest quarter-point to a still-low range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. It means that consumers and businesses will face higher loan rates over time. But Cox analysts said auto interest rates held steady in June, although they expect them to rise. Bankrate.com said on its website new-auto loans are now around 4.75 percent. Gas prices rose 63 cents per gallon over a year ago to an average price for regular of $2.86, according to AAA, taking a bigger bite out of household budgets. Here's how major automakers fared for the first six months of the year, according to Edmunds, which regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press: — General Motors, up 4.2 percent. — Ford, down 1.8 percent. — Toyota, up 3.0 percent. — Fiat Chrysler, up 4.5 percent. — Honda, down 0.5 percent — Nissan, down 4.8 percent. — Hyundai, down 3.3 percent — Volkswagen, up 7.2 percent",2471,2477,Auto Brand,134
971,"Artificial intelligence that controls your infotainment screen. A vehicle that can read your brain. Cars that can see around blind corners. These are some of the automotive tech highlights of CES 2018 in Las Vegas. The event has increasingly become a way for automakers to preview their developments in car technology, from production-ready to wildly speculative. Here are three trends that could be coming to a car near you. AI-POWERED INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMS Both Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz are showing how they will use artificial intelligence in a vehicle's infotainment system to turn it into a personal assistant. It's technology that, for now, is confined to smartphones or smart speakers. Hyundai's Intelligent Personal Agent is a voice-control technology that was co-developed by Silicon Valley-based SoundHound Inc., which specializes in voice-enabled AI. The intelligent part of such software is its ability to recognize multiple commands. For example, if you ask it, ""Tell me what the weather will be like tomorrow and text the kids to remind them about soccer practice,"" it would recognize two separate commands in the same sentence and complete each task accordingly. Hyundai's technology functions much like Apple's Siri or Google Assistant. It's designed to respond to commands but also to proactively aid drivers by, for example, reminding them of upcoming meetings and recommending a departure time based on traffic conditions. The system activates with the wake-up voice command, ""Hi, Hyundai."" Once queried, the AI-powered agent can help make a phone call, send text messages, search destinations, search music, check weather and manage schedules. It also allows drivers to use voice control for frequently used functions such as controlling air conditioning, sunroofs and door locks. Hyundai plans to install the Intelligent Personal Agent in new models as early as 2019. Mercedes-Benz is also debuting a new infotainment interface for its compact vehicles that's based on artificial intelligence and what it calls an ""intuitive"" operating system. There are few details on the system's capabilities so far, but the system is expected to make its way to some vehicles on the lower end of Mercedes' lineup this year. The display itself looks like the dual widescreen setup that Mercedes used in late-model E- and S-Class sedans. BRAIN-TO-VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY Nissan is demonstrating that the ""brain"" in an autonomous vehicle doesn't always have to be a computer and that a computer can be used to make a person a better driver. The company is one of the first to conduct research on brain-to-vehicle (B2V) technology. To engage the technology, the driver puts on a wired cap. Picture a much smaller, sleeker version of Doc Brown's brain wave analyzer in ""Back to the Future."" The device measures brain wave activity, which the vehicle's autonomous systems analyze and then use to anticipate your intended actions. Nissan says that brain-to-vehicle technology can predict driver behavior to shorten reaction time when a driver is in control, for instance by making steering wheel turns or braking 0.2 to 0.5 second faster. All this will be largely imperceptible to the driver, Nissan says. Brain-to-vehicle technology also is being tested to detect and evaluate discomfort during driving. This could be used to match the car's driving style to the driver's own style when the vehicle is in autonomous mode. ""There are a lot of situations where a vehicle's default action when driving autonomously would not be what the driver would actually want to do if they were in control,"" said Nicholas Maxfield, a Nissan spokesman. ""Reading brainwaves is one way to shrink that gap between vehicle action and driver expectation."" Of course, copying a human's driving style may not be ideal in all cases, he said. The last thing you'd want is an autonomous car that speeds and makes erratic lane changes. The goal is to maximize driver safety during autonomous operating without departing too much from the driver's own style. This technology is still many years away from making it into a production vehicle, but Nissan says it shows the potential of combining human and artificial intelligence. CARS THAT TALK TO EVERYTHING Finally, Ford is using the CES event to announce its recommitment to making all of its vehicles connected by 2019. In the short term, vehicle connectivity means you'll see more Ford vehicles outfitted with Wi-Fi hotspots, remote unlocking and location services. Ford also is announcing plans to adopt what's called ""cellular vehicle-to-everything"" technology (C-V2X for short) in the coming years. This technology will make it possible for its vehicles to communicate with smart traffic signals, other vehicles and even a gas pump — to make wireless payments, for example. Cellular vehicle-to-everything is a more advanced version of vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity (V2V) and uses cellular networks, which are faster than Wi-Fi, to communicate with other vehicles and roadside infrastructure, such as smart traffic signals and construction zone warnings. The cellular vehicle-to-everything technology also has the ability to communicate at short range, even when there is no cellular signal. So a vehicle would have the ability to see around blind corners and understand its environment in inclement weather. For example, it could detect icy conditions on a road and warn the driver and other connected vehicles of the hazard. Ford believes that cellular vehicle-to-everything technology is the key to getting more automakers to commit to connected-car systems and to standardize the technology that will be used. The chips this technology uses are not only faster, but they are also less expensive than the ones employed in current V2V systems. EDMUNDS SAYS: We don't expect to see many of these features, such as brain-to-vehicle technology, for several years. But smarter infotainment systems and more widespread availability of connected vehicles are just around the corner. _________ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1083,"DETROIT (AP) — A survey of new-vehicle buyers finds that car and truck quality hit a record high this year as automakers started to clear up bugs with infotainment systems. The annual survey by J.D. Power finds that buyers reported a record-low 93 problems per 100 vehicles during the first three months of ownership, four problems fewer than last year. The survey also found that Korean brands Genesis, Kia and Hyundai claimed the top three spots for the first time in new vehicle quality. Porsche and Ford rounded out the top five. J.D.

1090,"If you're in the market for a new SUV, it's important to know not only what's available now but also what's coming. Here are six SUVs going on sale in the next several months that we at Edmunds think are worth waiting for. Why these six? One thing they have in common is the latest technology. On top of updated infotainment systems, every vehicle on this list offers a full suite of advanced safety features. Some have a few more tricks up their sleeves, and all offer something unique in the hopes of winning your hard-earned dollar. VOLVO XC40 Volvo's newest SUV is the subcompact 2019 XC40. It offers plenty of safety and technology features, and it's been built to make the most of its available space. Some useful highlights include an integrated trash bin, a hook for holding takeout food, and door pockets that can fit a 15-inch laptop. Acceleration comes from a punchy 248-horsepower turbocharged engine. And a hybrid model is coming. Volvo is also using the XC40 to pioneer its new subscription-based Care By Volvo service. Similar to a pay-as-you-go phone plan, consumers pay a fixed monthly fee to get the XC40 with nearly everything covered, including insurance, and the option to change to another vehicle in as little as one year. The XC40 Momentum — the only trim available at launch — comes with a price tag of $35,200. Future base pricing starts at $33,200. HYUNDAI SANTA FE AND SANTA FE XL We have high hopes for the redesigned 2019 Santa Fe. The lineup includes a two-row compact SUV and the larger three-row Santa Fe XL. Both look modern and upscale inside and out and should be very competitive with SUVs from Honda and Toyota. Three engines will be available, including a 232-horsepower turbocharged gas engine and a 200-horsepower turbodiesel. The latter, along with optional load-leveling suspension, should make the Santa Fe a capable tow vehicle. The Santa Fe also offers a new Safe Exit Assist feature that can lock a door if it senses a passenger is about to swing it open in the path of an oncoming vehicle. Pricing on either SUV is not yet available. The Santa Fe Sport currently goes for about $25,000 while the Santa Fe is $31,000. ACURA RDX The newest generation of Acura's compact luxury SUV looks to be its biggest step forward. The 2019 RDX will feature Acura's agility-enhancing all-wheel-drive system, a new look, lots of interior storage space and a nicely appointed cabin. Acura has also replaced the RDX's dual-screen infotainment setup, which was clunky and outdated. The new system uses a clean, high-definition screen and a touchpad controller. Further equipped with luxury features, such as a panoramic sunroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a head-up display and a premium audio system, the RDX should be one of the best new Acuras in years. No pricing information is available for the newest Acura RDX, but the current generation starts at $36,000. SUBARU ASCENT Those in need of a capable family hauler will have a new choice to consider: the 2019 Ascent. Subaru's three-row SUV is packed with features to keep both driver and passengers happy. With up to eight USB ports available, the Ascent can keep everyone's devices charged. Three-zone climate control and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are all standard, as are traffic-adaptive cruise control and a frontal collision mitigation system. With a $31,995 base price, the Ascent can also be optioned with lots of luxury-oriented comforts, including cooled front seats, second-row sunshades, and a premium Harman Kardon sound system. With 260 horsepower, standard all-wheel drive and a 5,000-pound towing capacity, the Ascent should make a compelling midsize choice. LEXUS UX Another new subcompact luxury SUV, the 2019 Lexus UX takes a different approach to the segment with its overstated, aggressive styling. Inside, you'll find a sleek design reminiscent of Lexus' flagship LC 500 coupe, as well as a digital gauge cluster. Both a 168-horsepower gasoline engine and a 176-horsepower hybrid with all-wheel drive will be available. The UX is a high-tech little SUV. It can use GPS information to adjust the vehicle to road conditions and maximize fuel efficiency. And it can be outfitted with an adaptive suspension to enhance ride comfort and handling precision. Pricing is not yet available. JAGUAR I-PACE If you wanted an all-electric SUV, your only choice up until now was the Tesla Model X. But Jaguar will give you another option with its 2019 I-Pace. The I-Pace should provide about 240 miles of driving range on a fully charged battery and yield a sports-car-worthy 0-60 mph sprint of about 4.5 seconds. The I-Pace doesn't offer a lot of cargo space, but it comes with a luxuriously appointed interior and a sleek-looking tech interface. Before incentives, the I-Pace should come in around $70,000, which also makes its price tag smaller than the Model X's. EDMUNDS SAYS: Though there's no shortage of good SUVs available now, it's worth taking note of new models hitting dealer showrooms this summer and fall. One could end up suiting your needs the best. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds. Will Kaufman is an associate staff writer at Edmunds.

But cars — particularly small ones — are having a tough time getting buyers to look their way as SUVs grow in popularity. Car sales are expected to hit a record low this year after steadily declining for several years. SUVs surpassed cars for the first time in 2016, and the gap only widens.

1135,"DETROIT (AP) — Hyundai and Volkswagen each say they're partnering with a U.S. autonomous vehicle tech firm led by former executives from Google, Tesla and Uber. The companies on Thursday announced partnerships with Aurora Innovation, started last year by ex-Google autonomous car chief Chris Urmson and others. VW says its collaboration will help bring self-driving cars quickly to roads worldwide, while autonomous Hyundais are expected to be in the market by 2021. The partnerships are the latest in a string of tie-ups between traditional auto companies and tech firms as they race to be first with self-driving vehicles. Aurora is based in Pittsburgh and Palo Alto, California. It was started last year by Urmson, former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell. Terms of each partnership were not released, but Urmson, who is Aurora's CEO, said the startup will make a profit by helping Hyundai and VW develop safe autonomous vehicles. In an interview with The Associated Press, Urmson said he isn't sure exactly where money will be made in autonomous vehicles. It could be from developing sophisticated sensing and guidance systems, manufacturing vehicles or providing transportation as a service. ""The way the economics play out over time is still far from foregone,"" he said. ""We still don't know which of these pieces will be dominant or if they will find a happy equilibrium."" Urmson left Alphabet Inc.'s Google in 2016 after more than seven years of work on its autonomous vehicles. At Tesla Inc., Anderson led development of the company's semi-autonomous Autopilot system after its initial release, and he led development of the Model X SUV, according to Aurora's website. Bagnell was a founding member of Uber Technologies Inc.'s Advanced Technology Center that's working on autonomous cars in Pittsburgh. Germany-based Volkswagen AG, which produces about 10 million vehicles annually, hopes the tie-up will bring autonomous vehicle technology to all of its brands. The company says it has been working with Aurora for the past six months, integrating its sensors, hardware and software into VW vehicles. Hyundai Motor Co. said the partnership with Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to market that can operate without human input in most conditions. The partnership has yet to say how its first batch of self-driving vehicles will be used, but analysts expect they will likely be for commercial use, such as self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services, rather than for sales to individual consumers. General Motors said in November that its self-driving vehicles will carry passengers and deliver goods in big cities by 2019. Hyundai earlier joined with Cisco Systems Inc. and Baidu Inc. to collaborate on internet-connected cars. It has also set up a $45 million fund with South Korea's SK Telecom and Hanwha Asset Management to invest in artificial intelligence startups worldwide. The South Korean automaker plans to share more details of its project with Aurora during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, where it will also unveil the brand name of a new fuel-cell SUV that will be tested for self-driving technology. The company plans to show off some of its autonomous driving cars during the Winter Olympics Game next month in Pyeongchang, South Korea. ___ Youkyung Lee contributed to this report from Seoul.",15,21,Auto Brand,142

1177,"EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y. (AP) — Bitcoins can buy you a TAG Heuer watch, a cross-country flight or a meatball marinara sub. But really, how does it work? Purchases with bitcoin and other digital currencies remain rare relative to cash and credit cards. Many bitcoin holders value it more as an investment than a day-to-day currency. And the complex workings behind the notoriously volatile currency can be off-putting to neophytes. What are the fees? Are there taxes? How do you spend a currency that can devalue dramatically between ordering appetizers and paying the check? Buying with bitcoin can be as easy as tapping your phone, though there are some cautions. A look at a single bitcoin transaction, the sale of a 2017 Subaru from an upstate New York car dealer to a buyer from Virginia: ___ IN BUSINESS WITH BITCOIN Eugene Rubinchuk didn't get into digital currency for the anonymity or to strike a blow against centralized banking. He was just looking for more business. Rubinchuk and his father, who goes by ""Mike the Russian,"" already ham it up in local TV commercials for Michael's Auto Plaza wearing furry hats. Digital currency is just another potential edge. ""It's just a way to reach customers we normally couldn't reach, that normally wouldn't think of us,"" he said. The cars and truck on the lot near Albany are priced in U.S. dollars. Rubinchuk simply signed up for one of the services that allowed him to accept digital currencies if a bitcoin buyer came along. ___ CASHING IN CRYPTOCURRENCY Jonathan Cypert got into bitcoin early and made out well. In 2011, he read about a 2-year-old currency skyrocketing in value and soon invested $2,000 in computers to ""mine"" bitcoins for about a year and a half. That's the complicated process that rewards tech-savvy participants for verifying bitcoin transactions in its public ledger, called the blockchain. When he started, a single bitcoin was worth around $2.50. By the time he was ready to buy a used, low-mileage Subaru for his wife, a bitcoin was worth over $14,000. The 32-year-old Virginia resident sees his bitcoin cache as a nest egg to tide him over after he retires from the military. (Wary of attracting scammers, Cypert requested that his hometown and military branch not be made public). The purchase gave him a chance to recoup his investment many times over with a fraction of his cache. ""At this point it's like, why not?"" Cypert said. ""I might as well realize some of that gain."" ___ BITCOIN BARGAINING Rubinchuk and Cypert talked on the phone the evening of Jan. 2 and settled on a sale price on the Subaru WRX STI of $34,640. Then they had to agree on what that equaled in bitcoins judging by the exchange rates that moment. Tracking bitcoin prices on their screens, the pair agreed to proceed with one bitcoin equaling about $14,755. Cypert sent 2.34790481 bitcoins from his personal electronic wallet to the public address of Rubinchuk's wallet. Cypert also paid a network fee of about $3.50, money that goes to reward miners and keep the system running. Then Rubinchuk watched bitcoin's value go up and down as he waited to convert his digital money into dollars. ___ BLOCKCHAIN BLUES Rubinchuk wanted to convert quickly in case bitcoin's value suddenly dropped against the dollar, costing him money. The fear is well-founded, since bitcoin's value can gain or lose more than $400 in a half-hour. But the digital currency service he uses required him to wait for multiple confirmations from the bitcoin network before he could convert it into dollars, a process can be affected by network congestion and other factors. Rubinchuk recalls waiting about 30 to 45 minutes. ""I'm sitting there on pins and needles checking every five minutes if it's available,"" he said. Rubinchuk converted the sale into dollars with bitcoin just slightly below where it was at the time of the sale earlier that evening. He made about $7 less than the sale price. The money was in his business's bank account within 48 hours. Rubinchuk soon after signed up for a separate merchant account through another provider that assesses him a 1 percent fee on all transactions, insulating him from short-term volatility. He compares it favorably to credit card fees that run 2 to 3 percent for merchants. ___ KEEPING IT LEGAL Digital currencies are notoriously used by criminals to transfer funds anonymously. But Rubinchuk told the tax collector about this transaction. In a standard IRS form for cash payments over $10,000, he reported the money he received, from whom it came and the fact that it originated ""via bitcoin."" Cypert avoided sales tax under a federal law covering service members that lets him retain his official residency in Alaska, which does not have a sales tax. But he will pay taxes on a long-term capital gain. ___ YOUR TIME MAY VARY Bitcoin miner fees have dropped markedly this year, and advocates say congestion issues are being solved by new technologies. Rubinchuk waited about 15 minutes to make a dollar exchange last week for his second bitcoin sale, a 2016 Hyundai Elantra. And recently in Hillsboro, Oregon, Jeff Hanzlik bought $288 worth of marijuana-growing supplies from a store in a transaction that took a few minutes to finalize. He transmitted 0.03305451 in bitcoins from his phone, which read a code on the merchant's tablet. The same phone app allowed Hanzlik to choose to pay about a quarter in fees. ""Once you understand what this technology is and this genie's out of the bottle, you're not going to have any choice but to be using it in the future,"" Hanzlik said. But the bitcoin network at this stage is still not well suited for smaller, everyday transactions, said Christian Catalini, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Cryptoeconomics Lab. ""If you're thinking about paying for coffee in bitcoin, that's not what it's good at right now,"" he said. ""Things can change."" ___ Associated Press writer Gillian Flaccus in Hillsboro, Oregon, contributed to this report.",5040,5046,Auto Brand,144

1215,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court has tossed out a roughly $210 million deal to compensate owners and leaseholders of Hyundai and Kia models with overstated gas mileage figures. In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Tuesday that a lower court judge failed to determine whether differences in state consumer protection laws prevented a nationwide settlement. The panel sent the case back to the judge to conduct that analysis and also exclude used car owners from the deal. Hyundai and Kia announced in 2012 that they were lowering their fuel efficiency estimates for approximately 900,000 vehicles from model years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Kia spokesman James Bell said the company would seek review by a larger 9th Circuit panel.

1276,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Tuesday it has widened U.S. access to South Korea's car market while providing American manufacturers protection from South Korean imports. The United States and South Korea have reached an agreement to overhaul the six-year-old U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, senior administration officials said, confirming an announcement earlier Monday in Seoul. President Donald Trump had called the original Korea pact a job killer. The new deal doubles — to 50,000 — the cars each U.S. automaker can export annually to South Korea, reduces bureaucratic barriers to American products and extends a 25 percent U.S. tariff on South Korean pickup trucks by 20 years, through 2041. South Korea escapes America's new 25 percent tariff on imported steel — but must accept quotas on steel exports equal to 70 percent of its average annual shipments to the United States between 2015 and 2017. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the policy ahead of an official announcement. The United States this month began imposing the steel tariffs, saying imports jeopardized U.S. national security. But it has been suspending the duties on allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The U.S. Treasury Department is also in talks on a deal to prevent Seoul from deliberately pushing its currency lower to give South Korean exporters a competitive advantage. A formal agreement on currency would be unprecedented — but it wouldn't have teeth, because it would include no enforcement mechanism. The U.S. trade deficit in goods with South Korea — nearly $23 billion last year — widened after the original pact took effect in 2012, one reason Trump has denounced it. Trade in autos has been especially lopsided: South Korea last year exported to the United States 929,000 passenger vehicles worth $15.7 billion. By contrast, the U.S. shipped to South Korea fewer than 53,000 autos, worth just $1.5 billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. The United States says South Korea has used non-tariff barriers, such as rigorous customs inspections, to block U.S. products. Trump's complaints about South Korean trade practices have caused friction between the two allies at a crucial time, as he prepares for a meeting with North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Un. Unions at South Korea's two-largest automakers, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp., have already blasted the new agreement for blocking access to the fast-growing U.S. pickup truck market. ""It is a humiliating deal that accepts Trump's strategy to preemptively block South Korean pickup trucks,"" Hyundai Motor Company's labor union said in a statement.",2376,2382,Auto Brand,147

1318,"The average transaction price for new vehicles has been hovering above $35,000 this year, and briefly broke $36,000 at the end of 2017. But instead of buying a new vehicle, what if you took that money and applied it to purchasing a late-model luxury vehicle? For about the same money or less, you can typically get more interior refinement and comfort, better performance, and a vehicle that generally feels more special. Here are examples of six excellent used luxury cars. We've forgone a lot of the obvious entry-level choices such as the BMW 3 Series. For this list, we collected vehicles that are more unique and upscale. Even better, these cars are available as certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles, meaning buyers can get extended warranty coverage and take advantage of manufacturer financing deals that often offer low interest rates. Some companies are even beginning to offer CPO leases, which are perfect for shoppers who aren't yet ready to jump into used luxury-car ownership. SEDANS 2014-2017 With strong acceleration, excellent handling and an attractive cabin, the Cadillac CTS has what it takes to rival Europe's best sedans. Its touch-based controls can be frustrating to use, but this capable, sporty luxury sedan has more strengths than weaknesses. Keep an eye out for V6 and V-Sport models for a performance boost. From 2016 onward, smartphone connectivity and a rearview camera were standard. The CTS is a premium experience, and you'll find plenty of CPO examples for $30,000 or less. 2015-2016 The 2015 and 2016 Hyundai Genesis are very similar to their successor, the Genesis G80 sedan. Because of the name change when Hyundai spun off the Genesis brand, examples that still bear the Hyundai name are amazing bargains. Don't let the Hyundai badge fool you: The Genesis is a true luxury competitor. It has a comfortable interior trimmed in premium materials, easy-to-use tech features that you'd expect from a luxury car, and a choice of two strong engines. CPO prices are mostly under $30,000. 2014-2016 Few sedans exemplify a proper luxury sedan better than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. For around $36,000, you can find 2014 to 2016 E350 sedans. These were the last years of the previous -generation model. They don't have the ultra-impressive interior design of the newest E-Class, but they offer the same luxury and brand cachet. We picked the 2014 model year as our starting point because Mercedes updated it with slick new looks, interior tweaks, and a new suite of active safety features. Factor in these updates to the E350's superb ride quality, comfortable interior and solid-performing V6 engine, and you have an appealing and well-rounded luxury car. There's a big price spread, with older models starting around $26,000, while 2016 cars can still go for more than $35,000. SUVs 2016-2017 Thanks to its strong V6 engine, sporty handling, a long list of tech features, and a good amount of cargo space, the Acura RDX is an appealing compact luxury SUV. Slightly older models are still a good bet, but Acura improved the RDX's infotainment interface for 2016 and added a handful of active safety features and extra standard equipment. The RDX is a practical and rewarding choice, and it comes from a brand with a history of good reliability. Like the Mercedes, depending on age and equipment, the RDX can range from $25,000 to $35,000. 2014-2016 The midsize X5 really set the standard for the current crop of road-focused luxury SUVs, blending refinement and performance with utility and technology. A variety of engines areis available, including a high-torque diesel. We also like the X5's comfortable seating, steadfast stability, and wide spectrum of available features. A folding third-row seat is optional, though it's really only suitable for children. Expect to pay more than $30,000 for a good example. SUV ALTERNATIVE 2012-2016 To make the versatile XC70, Volvo took its practical and comfortable V70 wagon, raised its ride height and added all-wheel drive. Find a model with either the turbocharged inline-six or the turbocharged inline-five cylinder engine, and you'll have ample power to go with the ample cargo area and Volvo's excellent ergonomics. For 2012, Volvo improved the XC70's technology features, making that the year to start your search. The XC70 was discontinued after 2016, so the pool of CPO examples is shrinking. If you're looking for a versatile vehicle without as many compromises as an SUV, take a look at an XC70 before it disappears forever. Expect to pay around $28,000 to $32,000, although recent, higher trim-level versions can be pricier. EDMUNDS SAYS: Entry-level luxury cars have always been an appealing option for shoppers, but many buyers may not realize that all sorts of late-model luxury options are available for less than the average price of a new vehicle. Certified pre-owned examples can offer shoppers warranty and financing benefits that are similar to that of new cars, making them even more viable alternatives to brand-new vehicles. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1326,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (AP) — There's a competition at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics that has nothing to do with sports, and plenty to do with jousting between automakers and tech companies over autonomously driving vehicles. South Korea's largest automaker and a local telecom firm haggled for months over who would get to claim the exclusive right to label its vehicle as ""autonomous."" In the end, Hyundai Motors rolled out an ""autonomous"" sedan while KT Corp.'s self-driving bus was christened the ""5G Bus."" The self-driving vehicles on display at the Winter Olympics are showcasing South Korea's prowess in both automotive and telecoms technology. They took to the roads only after a sponsorship battle over whether such vehicles should be considered a form of transportation or a new kind of internet-connected device, like smartphones. Each Olympic corporate sponsor gets exclusive marketing rights in its own industry, so a blurring of boundaries between industries can lead to friction, said Kang Joon-ho, a sports marketing professor at Seoul National University. ""It's not clear whether we should see self-driving cars as vehicles or software, so it's unclear which sponsorship category they belong to."" In the end, a compromise was worked out. Hyundai Motor Co., the local sponsor for the transport category and the world's fifth-largest auto group, is seeking to dispel its image as a latecomer in autonomous driving. In Pyeongchang, it also is getting a jump on Japanese rivals that are preparing to deploy self-driving cars at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with its five autonomous Nexo fuel-cell cars. They are navigating without direct human control within a range of about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the Olympic stadium in the mountainous town. In a one-time test before the opening ceremony for the games, Hyundai had the Nexos drive 190 kilometers (118 miles) of highways from Seoul to Pyeongchang. The vehicles passed through toll gates and navigated junctions and tunnels without human controls or interruptions. It was the culmination of years of preparation, and development of 3D maps by the government. ""South Korea started late but we are at a level where we can pull off autonomous driving even in complicated, difficult situations,"" said Kim Jin-hoo, a deputy director at the transport ministry. ""We hope the event has helped ease public fears toward self-driving cars and piqued interest since the government aims to see self-driving cars commercialized by 2020."" Kwon Hyoung-Geun, head of Hyundai's Intelligent Safety Research Team, said the Nexo demonstration focuses on autonomous driving on public roads with steep curves, hills, tunnels, traffic lights, intersections and roundabouts. Hyundai is partnering with U.S.-based self-driving technology startup Aurora Innovation to develop self-driving vehicles that can operate without human input in most conditions, aiming to begin sales by 2021. Analysts expect Hyundai to launch self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services by then. As the local sponsor for wireless networks, KT, formerly state-owned Korea Telecom, is focusing on self-driving cars becoming the new data-guzzling devices of the future. Self-driving cars consume enormous amounts of data as sensors and chips monitor road conditions and analyze them in real time. KT, along with Intel and Samsung Electronics, has built 5G networks as a trial service in the Olympic towns to handle those mountains of data. Since it has the telecoms, not automotive sponsorship, for appearances' sake KT agreed not to present its two ""5G connected"" buses to the media as driving unmanned, even though that's how they are operating in the seaside town of Gangneung, where Olympic ice hockey and skating matches are underway. Leading global telecom carriers plan to roll out 5G networks in 2020. Such networks process data about 100 times faster than current fourth-generation wireless networks, a speed that enables users to download feature-length movies in a matter of a couple of seconds. KT plans to begin 5G services — the bus is one example — across South Korea in 2019. Despite its sponsorship rivalry with Hyundai, it also is providing 5G data networks to the Nexos, whose rear seats are outfitted with 5G entertainment services. The 5G connected buses are like giant moving smartphones, with passenger seat windows made of transparent displays instead of traditional glass that serve as screens for watching movies or displaying fictional landscapes, instead of just the view outside the bus. While some riders might prefer just to gaze at the landscape, Kim Hyung Joon, a senior vice president at KT, says the technology will liberate drivers to relax and watch movies. ""That way, cars will become very much similar to mobile devices that are connected all the time and consume data like a smartphone,"" Kim said. Unfortunately for international visitors, seats on the connected 5G buses that will be operating through Feb. 22 are all already booked solid. KT also is showing off 5G tablets and ways to experience winter sports through virtual reality and other 5G services at Olympic venues and at booths in Gangneung and Seoul. __ To book a ride in a Hyundai Nexo fuel cell car during the Olympics: https://lightupyourenergy.co.kr/en/nexo_experience/index.php __ Lee reported from Seoul, South Korea.

It also signals a resolve against protectionism at a time when the Trump administration is pursuing more aggressive action against trading partners perceived to be violating rules. Speaking at the World Economic Forum global summit in the Swiss Alps, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday's deal shows TPP members are pushing back against harmful ""anti-trade"" tendencies. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters in Brisbane the revised deal would bring billions of dollars in additional exports and thousands of additional jobs. FEDERAL RESERVE-POWELL Senate approves Powell to follow Yellen as Fed chair in Feb. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has approved President Donald Trump's selection of Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve beginning next month. Senators voted 85-12 to confirm Powell to lead the nation's central bank, a post that's considered the most powerful economic position in government. Powell will succeed Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed, when her term ends Feb. 3. Trump decided against offering Yellen a second four-year term as chair despite widespread praise for her performance since succeeding Ben Bernanke. Powell, 64, has served for 5½ years on the Fed's board. A lawyer and investment manager by training, he will be the first Fed leader in 40 years without an advanced degree in economics. Many expect him to follow Yellen's cautious approach to interest rates. CONGRESS-EPA-DOURSON Trump pick who failed to win Senate support is leaving EPA WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee chemical safety is departing the Environmental Protection Agency a month after withdrawing his nomination in the face of concerns over his ties to the chemical industry.

EPA had previously refused to comment on whether he was still working at the agency or say how much he is being paid. Records show other senior advisers to Pruitt earn about $170,000 annually. Democrats were united in opposition to Dourson's nomination to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention.

DAVOS FORUM Trump to tell Davos the US 'open for business' DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to meet with world leaders, dine with business executives and declare America ""open for business"" during his trip to the Davos summit. White House officials said Tuesday the president is going to the World Economic Forum to promote his economic policies. He departs Wednesday and arrives in Switzerland on Thursday. Trump meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. There is a reception in his honor that night and he will host a small dinner for European companies. On Friday, he meets with Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Swiss President Alain Berset, before delivering a keynote address. Top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn says the president is going to Davos to ""tell the world that America is open for business."" JAPAN-TRADE Japan exports up 12 percent in 2017 in tail wind for growth TOKYO (AP) — Japan reports its exports rose 12 percent in 2017 from a year earlier in a strong tail wind for the economy, while imports jumped 14 percent. The recovery in trade is driving stronger growth in Japan, though the trade surplus dropped 25 percent to 3 trillion yen ($27 billion). The preliminary data released today also showed exports climbing 9 percent in December from a year earlier while imports surged 15 percent. A rebound in shipments to China as its economy gains momentum has been a boon for Japan's manufacturers. Preliminary results from the Nikkei monthly survey of purchasing managers showed surging new orders helped push factory activity in January to its fastest pace in nearly four years. Exports to the U.S., Japan's largest export market, rose 6.8 percent in 2017. GOOGLE-LOBBYING Google parent tops big spenders on Washington lobbyists WASHINGTON (AP) — Google parent Alphabet Inc. outspent all other companies on lobbying Washington bureaucrats and politicians in 2017, a year in which it and other tech giants were hauled before legislators probing Russian influence in the 2016 election. The search giant doled out $13.6 million on lobbying firms like Prime Policy Group and Gephardt Group, edging out the $13.2 million spent by AT&T, which is facing government opposition to its takeover of Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion. The figures were compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Lawyers from Google, Facebook and Twitter were grilled by lawmakers the week of Nov. 1 for not preventing abuse of their platforms by Russian agents masquerading as Americans. Alphabet's spending actually fell 12 percent compared to 2016, but AT&T also cut back. HYUNDAI-KIA-OVERSTATED MILEAGE Court tosses out $210M deal over Hyundai, Kia gas mileage SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court has tossed out a roughly $210 million deal to compensate owners and leaseholders of Hyundai and Kia models with overstated gas mileage figures. In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Tuesday that a lower court judge failed to determine whether differences in state consumer protection laws prevented a nationwide settlement. The panel sent the case back to the judge to conduct that analysis and also exclude used car owners from the deal. Hyundai and Kia announced in 2012 that they were lowering their fuel efficiency estimates for approximately 900,000 vehicles from model years 2011, 2012 and 2013. IMMIGRANT ARRESTS-MOTEL 6 Suit alleges Motel 6 discriminated against Latino customers PHOENIX (AP) — A civil rights group alleges that Motel 6 discriminated against some Latino customers at two locations in Phoenix by giving their whereabouts and personal information to U.S. immigration agents who later arrested at least seven guests.

CHINA-US-TREASURY DEBT China: Report buying of US debt might stop is 'fake news' BEIJING (AP) — China's foreign exchange regulator has challenged a news report that it might slow or stop purchases of U.S. Treasury debt due to trade tensions with Washington as ""fake news."" The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, one of the biggest holders of Treasurys, says it is a ""responsible investor"" for both the reserves and for ""participating markets.""

TRUMP-CONSUMER WATCHDOG Court rules in favor of Trump over fate of consumer watchdog NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge has ruled in favor of President Donald Trump and the White House over the control of a national financial watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Judge Timothy Kelly has issued an order denying Leandra English, the deputy director of the CFPB, a restraining order that would have stopped Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, from taking on a second role as acting director of the agency. The conflict arose late last month when Richard Cordray, named by President Barack Obama to lead the CFPB, stepped down and named English as his replacement. In response, the White House named Mulvaney as the replacement for Cordray. Kelly had expressed skepticism in hearings last month about whether English would prevail in her case. CANADA-US-TRADE COMPLAINT Canada launches trade complaint against US over duties OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canada has launched an attack on U.S. trade practices with an international complaint over Washington's use of punitive duties. The complaint ramps up tensions amid talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade agreement. Canada wants the World Trade Organization to examine the use of duties in the United States, alleging they violate international law. The complaint was filed last month but released Wednesday. The U.S. just announced duties of up to 9 percent on Canadian paper. It follows a series of similar penalties as the U.S. alleges unfair trade practices by Canada in the form of softwood lumber and Bombardier subsidies. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement that Canada's complaint is a ""broad and ill-advised attack on the U.S. trade remedies system.""

And according to NPD BookScan, its numbers are likely to grow far higher. BookScan announced Wednesday that ""Fire and Fury"" sold 29,000 copies. But Wolff's explosive tell-all about the Trump administration only came out last Friday and BookScan's weekly sales run through Saturday. Kristen McLean, the NPD Group's book industry analyst, says ""The first couple of days of sales figures aren't giving us the full picture."" McLean noted that Hillary Clinton's ""What Happened,"" which came out last September, averaged sales of more than 30,000 hardcover copies per day in its opening week. But that book ""was hugely anticipated and very well stocked."" ""Fire and Fury"" seemed to catch everyone off guard, including Henry Holt and Co.

(AP) — Alabama has entered the fast lane in its bid to become a major auto making hub in the South, landing a coveted $1.6 billion joint venture plant of Toyota and Mazda that is to eventually employ thousands. The new plant will be located in Huntsville, Alabama — already a hub for the region's aerospace industry — and will produce 300,000 vehicles per year, a combination of the Toyota Corolla compact car and a new small crossover SUV from Mazda. Production is expected to begin by 2021. Toyota and Mazda will join Mercedes, Honda and Hyundai which operate assembly plants in Alabama.

Murray Energy chairman Robert ""Bob"" Murray claimed the rollbacks would help revive the struggling mining industry. A review by The Associated Press of that March 1 plan shows Murray, an early Trump campaign supporter, has gotten about half the items on his wish list. Still others, such as eliminating federal tax credits for wind turbines and solar panels, failed to win approval in Congress.

1384,"DETROIT (AP) — January's U.S. auto sales were a little better than a year ago, but most analysts and automakers predict a small full-year decline despite economic factors that favor the industry. Automakers reported a 1 percent increase last month to 1.15 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. But Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, the country's largest dealership group, said late-model used cars coming off leases are pulling buyers from higher-priced new vehicles. Despite tax reform, low unemployment and strong consumer confidence, he sees new-car sales falling to 16.8 million from last year's 17.2 million. During the past few years, automakers pushed leasing to around 30 percent of sales. Now, Jackson says 4 million well-equipped used cars will be available for an average price of $25,000. ""You have to say 'who is going to buy all these things when they come back?'"" Jackson said. ""Of course there's going to be a cannibalization and a substitution."" Car sales fell nearly 11 percent while truck and SUV sales were up 8 percent. Here are the numbers released by automakers Thursday: — Honda Motor Co. said sales were down 1.7 percent to 104,542. Truck and SUV sales fell 2.5 percent while cars were off just under 1 percent. The CR-V small SUV, in the hottest part of the market, saw a 16.9 percent sales drop. — Hyundai Motor Co. sales fell 11.3 percent from last year's record January, to 39,629. The car-heavy Korean automaker saw Sonata midsize sedan sales tumble 23.7 percent. — Nissan Group sales rose 10 percent to 123,538, a January record. Sales were led by the Rogue small SUV, which was up nearly 26 percent to more than 36,000. Nissan brand sales rose 12 percent but Infiniti luxury sales dropped 8 percent. — Ford Motor Co. sales fell 6.6 percent to 161,143, due in part to a decline in sales to rental car fleets. But its average vehicle sales price hit a record $37,000, largely due to a 1.6 percent sales increase for the higher priced F-Series pickup. Car sales were down 23.3 percent. — General Motors Co. sales rose 1 percent to 198,548. Buick and Chevrolet posted gains, but GMC and Cadillac saw lower sales. GM's best-seller, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup, saw a 14.5 percent jump. A new Silverado goes on sale later this year, so GM is discounting the outgoing truck. — Toyota Motor Corp. posted a 16.8 percent increase to 167,056 vehicles on strong demand for the RAV4, Highlander and 4Runner SUVs, which hit January sales records. Sales of the revamped Camry midsize car rose 21.3 percent, bucking the SUV trend. — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were down 13 percent due to reduced sales to fleet buyers. The company sold nearly 133,000 vehicles, led by a 2 percent increase in Jeep sales. But the Chrysler brand fell 21 percent while Dodge was off 31 percent and Fiat dropped 43 percent.

1404,"DETROIT (AP) — Long emergency stopping distances, difficult-to-use controls and a harsh ride stopped Tesla's Model 3 electric car from getting a recommended buy rating from Consumer Reports. While the magazine said the car has exhilarating acceleration and handling, testers were troubled by its 152-foot average stopping distance from 60 miles per hour in emergency braking tests. The magazine said the distance was worse than any modern car it has tested, and is about 7 feet longer than a Ford F-150, a full-size pickup truck that weighs about twice as much as a Model 3. Tesla said in a statement that its own tests found 60-to-zero braking distances averaging 133 feet. It says stopping distances are affected by road surface, weather, tire temperature, brake conditioning and other factors. It also says it continually does software updates to improve factors such as stopping distance. The Model 3 is Tesla's first attempt to appeal to mass-market buyers. The car that starts at $35,000 but can run as high as $78,000 has been plagued by production delays. Consumer Reports said it tested the car at its track on pavement monitored for consistent surface friction, using industry standard test procedures. The car was tested with the same 18-inch Michelin tires that were used in Tesla's test, the magazine said. On the first Consumer Reports test, the Model 3 stopped in about 130 feet, similar to Tesla's findings, according to the magazine. But testers could not repeat that distance even after letting the brakes cool overnight, it said. Because of the inconsistency, the testers borrowed a second Model 3 and got results similar to longer distances in testing the first one. The Tesla's stopping distance was 21 feet longer than the class average for luxury compact sedans, the magazine said. Jake Fisher, director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, said the first test shows him that the Model 3 has the mechanical ability to stop in 130 feet and that a software change may bring consistently shorter stopping distances. If that happens, Consumer Reports would re-evaluate the car, he said. Consumer Reports also said that Car and Driver magazine experienced inconsistent and sometimes long stopping distances when it tested a Model 3, including one stop from 70 mph that took 196 feet. Although it doesn't happen often, Consumer Reports in the past has decided not to recommend vehicles based largely on long braking distances. Last year the magazine decided not to recommend the Hyundai Ioniq gas-electric hybrid car because of below-average braking. It took the car 144 feet to fully stop from 60 mph on dry pavement. The magazine also said nearly all of the Model 3's controls are on a center touch screen direction with no gauges on the dashboard and few buttons inside the car. This forces drivers to take several steps to do simple tasks and can cause driver distraction, the magazine said. The car also had a stiff ride and excessive wind noise at highway speeds, unlike competitors, Consumer Reports said. Consumer Reports also said it got a record 350 miles of range per charge with a long-range version of the Model 3 when it's set on a high mode to recharge batteries with energy from braking. The magazine said it took delivery of the Model 3 that it purchased on Feb. 8, and it was the latest model available at the time. Consumer Reports recommends Tesla's Model S, ranking it No. 1 in the ultra-luxury car category. But its other model currently on sale, the Model X SUV, is not recommended due to low reliability.",2497,2503,Auto Brand,155
1412,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. auto industry's historic growth streak has ended, but demand for new vehicles — especially SUVs — remains healthy as the new year begins. U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million in 2017, according to Autodata Corp. It was their first year-over-year decline since 2009, ending an unprecedented seven-year expansion. General Motors, Toyota and Ford all reported a 1 percent declines in sales last year compared to 2016. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 8 percent. Honda's sales were flat, while Nissan's rose 2 percent. Volkswagen brand sales rose 5 percent. While sales fell short of 2016's record of 17.55 million, 2017 was still the fourth-best sales year in U.S. history, after 2000, 2015 and 2016, according to Kelley Blue Book. ""It's still a buoyant industry and the underlying factors that drive it are still very positive,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales chief. Analysts think sales will fall a bit further this year. While low unemployment and rising consumer confidence are expected to boost demand, rising interest rates could make it more expensive for people to finance new vehicles. ""That's real money to consumers,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist with Cox Automotive, which owns AutoTrader.com and other car-buying sites. Vehicles also are becoming more durable so consumers can keep them longer, further putting a drag on sales. The average age of vehicles on the road has climbed to 11.6 years, up from 8.8 years in 1998. The growing popularity of leasing will also have a big impact on 2018 sales. Almost one-third of new vehicle sales were leases in 2015, and many of those 4 million lessees will be trading in their vehicles for new ones, according to the car buying site Edmunds.com. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) But leasing also has a downside for automakers, since the influx of late-model used cars returning to the market will cut into sales of new vehicles. Tax cuts also could be a mixed blessing. They will likely stimulate demand, particularly for commercial trucks and vans. But the more the economy grows, the more likely it is that the government will raise interest rates, Chesbrough said. Here are more details of December and 2017 sales: —WINNERS AND LOSERS: Ford's F-Series pickup truck remained the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. in 2017, a title it has now held for 36 years. Ford sold 896,764 F-Series trucks in the U.S. last year, or nearly two trucks every minute, partly because of post-hurricane demand in Texas and Florida. Low gas prices and other factors had buyers ditching cars for SUVs at a fast clip; sales of the Nissan Rogue SUV jumped 22 percent to more than 400,000. But car-heavy brands like Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat all saw their sales drop by double-digit percentages. Toyota Prius hybrid sales plummeted 20.5 percent. — LUXURY CROWN: Mercedes-Benz's sales fell 1 percent to 337,246, but that was still enough to make it the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. for the second straight year. BMW eked out a second-place finish just ahead of Lexus. But some luxury brands struggled. Cadillac and Lexus both saw their sales drop 8 percent last year; Lincoln sales plummeted 17 percent in December. LaNeve said mainstream brands are getting so luxurious that many buyers don't feel the need to step up to a luxury label. — PILING ON THE DEALS: New vehicle prices hit a record last year, averaging $36,113 as buyers bought bigger SUVs and added more safety and infotainment features, Kelley Blue Book said. At the same time, automakers piled on deals in order to juice sales and hang on to their market share. Automakers spent an average of $4,302 per vehicle in incentives last month, passing the previous record set in November, according to the consulting firm J.D. Power. Chevrolet was offering $11,000 off a 2017 Silverado pickup last month. Analysts expect a pullback in incentive spending this year as automakers cut inventory. But there will still be good deals, especially on slow-selling vehicles like midsize sedans. — DECEMBER DIP: No one was expecting U.S. auto sales to top December 2016, which was the best single month in 15 years. Sales dropped 5 percent to 1.6 million last month. Ford's sales were up 1 percent in December as its new large SUVs hit the market, and Hyundai's sales rose 2 percent. But most other automakers saw declines. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 11 percent , while Toyota's sales dropped 8 percent and Nissan's sales were down 9.5 percent. GM's sales fell 3 percent. Volkswagen's dropped 19 percent.",4380,4386,Auto Brand,156

1438,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. says it will begin selling its first self-driving vehicles by 2021 in partnership with U.S.-based self-driving technology startup Aurora Innovation Inc. The South Korean company said Thursday that in three years, Hyundai and Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to markets that can operate without human input in most conditions. The auto industry designates that as ""level 4 autonomous driving,"" just one stage short of fully autonomous driving. Aurora was founded by a former chief technology officer at Google's self-driving car unit, a former Tesla Autopilot director and a former self-driving engineer at Uber.

1441,"The 2018 Hyundai Kona and 2018 Ford EcoSport are two all-new subcompact crossover SUVs that are getting a lot of attention this year. Like similar vehicles such as the Honda HR-V, the Kona and EcoSport provide an elevated riding position and everyday utility, but are more maneuverable and typically less expensive than more established compact SUVs. Edmunds takes a look at each to determine which one holds a clear advantage. SPEC SHEET DIFFERENCES Both the Kona and EcoSport start around the $20,000 mark and climb to about $27,000 at their maximum. The EcoSport is about 3 inches taller, but 3 inches shorter in length, too. Kia's basic warranty covers the Kona for five years or 60,000 miles. Ford's warranty for the EcoSport is shorter: three years or 36,000 miles. Neither model is a powerhouse in the base trim level. The Kona starts you off with a rather lackluster 147-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The EcoSport's 123-hp turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder is even less inspiring. However, both of these pint-size SUVs offer optional engine upgrades. The Kona can be had with a pleasantly powerful 175-horsepower 1.6-liter turbocharged engine on the top Limited and Ultimate trim levels. Ford offers a 166-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder option that is available on all higher EcoSport trims and comes standard on the sporty SES version. All-wheel drive is included with EcoSport's upgraded engine and is an option for all Konas. You should also consider getting all-wheel drive on the Hyundai because it comes with an upgraded suspension, which gives the Kona more composed handling. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Kona maintains a fuel economy advantage of 2 mpg over comparable EcoSports. When it comes to standard features, the Kona generally outpaces the EcoSport. Most items typically found on rivals are available on both SUVs, but the EcoSport requires that you add them as options or step up to the next trim level. The Kona widens its features lead by offering more advanced safety features (forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist and a driver attention monitor), a head-up display and a wireless charging pad. These are not available for any EcoSport. GREATER DIFFERENCES IN PERSON The 9-horsepower difference between the premium engines might not seem like much. But you'll feel the difference when you're behind the wheel. The turbocharged Kona should accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in the mid-6-second range, which is very quick for the subcompact SUV class. By contrast, the EcoSport, even with its upgraded four-cylinder engine, needed a sluggish 10.5 seconds in Edmunds testing to do the same sprint. Neither model is what we'd consider sporty, but the Kona feels more confidently anchored to the pavement when the road curves. When the pavement ends, the Kona is more capable of light off-roading thanks to a locking center differential, which helps improve traction. Normally, more accomplished handling and off-road abilities mean a less comfortable ride, but that's not the case here. The Kona transmits a fair amount of road imperfection into the cabin, but the EcoSport's ride is even choppier. According to the specifications, the EcoSport holds a marginal lead over the Kona for cargo capacity, with 20.9 cubic feet and 19.2 cubic feet, respectively. In the real world, though, the Kona's space is just as good, if not better. The EcoSport's cargo area is very shallow and upright compared to the Kona's. Furthermore, the Kona's rear seats fold flat with the cargo floor, while the EcoSport's seats protrude a few inches above the floor. Then there's the difference in the cargo hatches themselves. The Kona has a conventional liftgate that is hinged at the top, while the EcoSport's swing-out hatch is hinged on the driver's side. Each has its fans, but we think most owners will find the Kona's top-hinged hatch easier to live with. OTHER ASPECTS TO CONSIDER The Hyundai gains yet another advantage when it comes to outward visibility. It's only average for the class, but the EcoSport is below-average because its thick roof pillars and narrow rear window limit what you can see from the driver's seat. On more subjective ground, finding true beauty in either the Hyundai or the Ford might be difficult. The Kona's exterior styling is disjointed, with odd elements that seem as though they were pulled from other vehicles. By contrast, the EcoSport's angular styling cues are in line with the rest of Ford's lineup, but its tall roof and the stubby proportions of its nose and tail make it look more like an elevated hatchback rather than a crossover SUV. EDMUNDS SAYS: The 2018 Hyundai Kona holds a definite advantage over the 2018 Ford EcoSport. The Kona offers superior performance, greater everyday usability, and more features for the money. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1451,DETROIT (AP) — Kia is recalling over a half-million vehicles in the U.S. because the air bags may not work in a crash. The recall apparently is related to federal investigation into air bag failures in Kia and partner Hyundai vehicles that were linked to four deaths. Vehicles covered by the recall include 2010 through 2013 Forte compact cars and 2011 through 2013 Optima midsize cars. Also covered are Optima Hybrid and Sedona minivans from 2011 and 2012. A Hyundai spokesman says he's checking to see if his company has a recall. Kia says it's working on a remedy and will notify owners June 27. Kia says in government documents that a short circuit can develop in an air bag control computer. The company has not yet developed a repair.,218,224,Auto Brand,92
1465,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. said Thursday it will begin selling its first self-driving vehicles by 2021 in partnership with U.S. based self-driving technology startup Aurora Innovation Inc. Within in three years, Hyundai and Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to markets that can operate without human input in most conditions, the company said in a statement. The auto industry designates that as ""level 4 autonomous driving,"" just one stage short of fully autonomous driving. The partnership has yet to say how its first batch of self-driving vehicles will be used, but analysts expect they likely be for commercial use, such as self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services, rather than for sales to individual consumers. General Motors said in November that its self-driving vehicles will carry passengers and deliver goods in big cities by 2019. Aurora was founded by a former chief technology officer at Google's self-driving car unit, a former Tesla Autopilot director and a former self-driving engineer at Uber. Hyundai has been pursuing partnerships to keep pace with changes in an industry that is being transformed by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and other cutting edge-technologies. It earlier joined with Cisco Systems Inc. and Baidu Inc. to collaborate on internet-connected cars. It has also set up a $45 million fund with South Korea's SK Telecom and Hanwha Asset Management to invest in artificial intelligence startups worldwide. The South Korean automaker plans to share more details of its project with Aurora during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, where it will also unveil the brand name of a new fuel-cell SUV that will be tested for self-driving technology.

1489,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor said Thursday that its first-quarter profit plunged to its lowest level in more than eight years as sales dwindled in the United States and China. South Korea's largest automaker said its January-March earnings sank a larger-than-expected 48 percent to 731.6 billion won ($677.3 million), compared with 1.4 trillion won a year earlier. The result was far below the market consensus. Analysts expected 942.1 billion won in quarterly earnings, according to financial data provider FactSet. Quarterly profit was nearly halved as car sales in China and the United States sank further. The company also blamed the local currency's steep rise against the U.S. dollar and a walkout by its union. Sales fell 4 percent to 22.4 trillion won ($20.7 billion) while operating income also sank 46 percent to 681.3 billion won ($631 million) during the three-month period. Its first-quarter car sales fell 2 percent from a year earlier to 1.05 million units. The maker of Tucson and Sonata is banking on the release of new SUV models to revive sales. While the first-quarter sales in the U.S. slumped 31 percent from a year earlier and dropped 17 percent in China, the South Korean automaker said there were a few bright spots. In China, monthly sales turned positive in March from a year earlier after Hyundai released some new models there. In the U.S., Hyundai's inventory levels have begun to show signs of stabilization, it said. Hyundai has been spending big on incentives in the U.S. market as competition heightened.

Technology companies, which put up some of the biggest gains in the last year, continued to outpace the rest of the market Thursday. Banks were benefiting from higher bond yields, which allow them to charge higher interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans. Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo posted solid gains in midday trading. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.48 percent. MORTGAGE RATES Average 30-year mortgage rates slip to 3.95 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates fell this week, making it slightly more affordable to borrow for a home. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slipped to 3.95 percent from 3.99 percent last week. The average has tumbled from 4.20 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 3.38 percent from 3.44 percent in the prior week. This same rate average 3.44 percent last year. The interest charged on U.S. Treasury notes dropped from a week ago, causing mortgage rates to slip in response. The average on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages slipped to 3.45 percent from 3.47 percent last week. ADP Survey: US businesses add a strong 250,000 jobs in December WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. companies closed out 2017 with strong hiring in December, adding the most jobs in nine months. Payroll processor ADP says that businesses added 250,000 jobs last month, up from 185,000 in November. The gains were led by robust hiring in health care, professional services such as accounting and engineering, and retail. The figures suggest that businesses are optimistic about the economic outlook and are staffing up to meet greater demand. ADP's data bodes well for the government's monthly jobs report, to be released Friday. Economists forecast that will show a gain of 189,000 jobs, according to a survey by data provider FactSet. The unemployment rate is projected to remain at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. MACY'S-OUTLOOK Macy's saw growth for the holidays NEW YORK (AP) — Macy's says it enjoyed sales growth during the holiday season, but the improvement wasn't enough to offset a tough year. The department store said Thursday sales at established stores rose 1 percent in the November-December period. It now expects that figure to decline between 2.4 percent and 2.7 percent for the year. Total revenue is forecast to decline 3.6 percent to 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier. Macy's also says it will close another 11 stores early this year, cut jobs and streamline non-store functions. That should produce savings of about $300 million. Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 3.4 percent for the nine-week period ended Dec. 30. The holiday sales growth is encouraging for department stores, which are struggling to reinvent themselves. INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES New health insurance rule aims to deliver on Trump promise WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is proposing regulations to facilitate the interstate sale of health insurance policies that cost less but may not cover as much. But it's not immediately clear whether the new proposal from the Labor Department will fulfill President Donald Trump's long-standing promise to promote competition across the country. The rule would make it easier for groups — or associations — to sponsor health plans that don't have to meet all consumer protection and benefit requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Those requirements improve coverage, but they also raise premiums. Insurers are skeptical of Trump's idea. Patient groups are concerned about losing protections. And some state regulators object to federal interference. There's another wrinkle: Health insurance, like real estate, reflects local costs, which vary widely. BRAZIL-FACEBOOK-FALSE NEWS Facebook to combat false news in Brazil ahead of election SAO PAULO (AP) — Facebook is announcing initiatives in Brazil to counter false news reports that are expected to proliferate as the country heads toward October elections. The social media giant says one of the projects is a free online course designed for teens, young adults and educators on how to spot and contain the spread of false stories. It will also create a Messenger bot that will tip users on online information. The initiatives are to be in place by June, when Brazil's presidential campaign is set to accelerate. Claudia Gurfinkel is Facebook's head of news partnerships for Latin America. She said Thursday in a statement that the initiatives are the result of discussions with academics, news literacy experts, fact-checking agencies and journalism associations. PUERTO RICO-CORRUPTION New Puerto Rico law targets graft, shields whistleblowers SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico's governor has signed a new law aimed at fighting corruption in the U.S. territory amid a deep economic crisis. The measure bars judges from granting probation to anyone accused of corruption, obstruction of justice or any other charge that involves public funds. People convicted of graft are prohibited from running for elected office. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Thursday that the law also strengthens protections for whistleblowers and increases the statute of limitations for those seeking to file a civil complaint for alleged reprisals. The government can seek triple the amount of compensation in a civil claim for any case involving misuse of public money that results in a conviction.

The companies on Thursday announced partnerships with Aurora Innovation, started last year by ex-Google autonomous car chief Chris Urmson and others. VW says its collaboration will help bring self-driving cars quickly to roads worldwide, while autonomous Hyundais are expected to be in the market by 2021. The partnerships are the latest in a string of tie-ups between traditional auto companies and tech firms as they race to be first with self-driving vehicles. Aurora is based in Pittsburgh and Palo Alto, California. It was started last year by Urmson, former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell.

1547,"Most of us know the new-car basic warranty, often referred to as the ""bumper-to-bumper warranty,"" is designed to protect the owner against any factory defects during the first few years of ownership. But did you know this coverage doesn't actually apply to the bumpers? The vehicle's bumpers are considered body panels and so aren't covered. The basic warranty is just one kind of coverage that comes standard on a new car. Here's an overview of new-car warranties and seven things you might not know about them: WARRANTY BASICS A new car comes with a basic or limited warranty, which covers everything except body panels, drivetrain components and wear-and-tear items such as brake pads, oil filters and wiper blades. It also comes with a drivetrain warranty, which covers most of the parts that make the car move, such as the engine, transmission, drive axles and driveshaft. Most carmakers provide roadside assistance. Some also offer free maintenance for a period of time. FINE PRINT ON 10-YEAR POWERTRAIN WARRANTIES Automakers Hyundai, Kia and Mitsubishi tout their decade-long powertrain warranties, and that's great for new-car buyers who plan to hold on to their car for a while. But if you plan on buying one of those cars used, that 10-year warranty doesn't apply to you. You'll only get a five-year, 60,000-mile warranty dating from when the vehicle was first sold. A partial way around this issue is to buy the car as a certified pre-owned vehicle from a dealership. If there was a 10-year powertrain warranty, you'll get the remainder of that term, probably seven or so years. TIRES HAVE A SEPARATE WARRANTY New-car tires are not covered by the vehicle's basic warranty. Instead, the warranty comes from the tiremaker, and it's outlined in a booklet you should find in your new car's glove box. The tire warranty protects against premature tire wear or manufacturing defects. Make sure you keep the tires properly inflated and hold onto receipts from any tire rotations you have done, just in case you need to file a warranty claim and are asked to prove that the tires were properly maintained. WARRANTY COVERAGE CAN CHANGE Warranties and their included benefits are subject to change. If an automaker wants to spur sales, it may offer a longer warranty or other special coverage, such as free maintenance. If the car company's research shows that a certain benefit isn't driving people to dealerships, it can reduce the coverage. Back in 2010, for example, Volvo offered five years of free maintenance. It has now scaled that back to three years. GMC and Chevrolet vehicles once came with a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, but that changed with the 2016 model year. Now the powertrain warranty is good for only 60,000 miles. Warranty changes aren't retroactive, however. Whatever coverage was in force for your car's model year will apply if you need repairs or service covered by the warranty. RANGE OF COVERAGE Starting with the 2018 model year, Volkswagen offers a six-year or 72,000-mile basic warranty. This coverage effectively doubled the warranty from the prior model years and is the longest-lasting among all brands. The shortest basic warranty currently is three years or 36,000 miles, and you'll find it on vehicles from Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota, for example. Makers including Acura, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Fiat, Mercedes-Benz and Mini offer four-year or 50,000-mile basic warranties. A handful, including Genesis, Hyundai, Jaguar and Kia, offer five-year or 60,000-mile basic coverage. ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE Roadside assistance is part of nearly every new-car warranty and lasts as long, if not longer, than the basic warranty. Not so for Toyota, however; its roadside coverage lasts just two years, even though the warranty is for three. EXTRA COVERAGE FOR EV AND HYBRID BATTERIES Batteries are critical to the operation of electric vehicles or hybrid cars and are expensive to replace. A Nissan Leaf battery costs $5,000, for example. Battery components are not part of the basic warranty, but there's good news: Under federal emissions regulations, EV and hybrid batteries must be warrantied for at least eight years or 100,000 miles. This coverage is fully transferable to all subsequent owners. 'GOODWILL' REPAIR Imagine that an expensive part breaks on your vehicle and your warranty has just expired. Normally, you'd have to pay up. But if the dealership service manager approves it, you can get a one-time exemption. This goodwill gesture is entirely at the discretion of your local dealership service department. But if you have a track record of having the maintenance performed there and ask nicely, you'll increase your chances of approval.

1550,"For people looking to buy a car that's fun to drive, practical and relatively affordable, 2018 could be opportunity knocking. You might say that it's the year of the performance hatchback. Exemplified by the long-running Volkswagen Golf GTI, a performance hatchback is a hopped-up version of a regular compact economy car that has a more powerful engine, a performance-tuned suspension and grippier tires. It can rival a sports car for driving enjoyment while also being better suited for everyday driving. Automakers have introduced more such models recently, some with sophisticated features and race-ready engines. The greater competition could help you get a good deal this summer, too. Dealer pricing for many of these cars is well below MSRP, according to Edmunds' data on the average price paid. The sought-after Ford RS and the Honda Civic Type R are the exceptions. That said, here are eight top models to check out. and Ford has said it's going to stop selling most of its cars in favor of SUVs, so now might be the time to buy. The Focus ST comes with a 252-horsepower turbocharged engine, while the rally racing-inspired Focus RS cranks out 350 horsepower through a specialized all-wheel-drive system for greater traction. Both cars are lively handlers and bring excitement to any drive. The standard manual transmission enhances the enthusiast credibility of these cars, but the lack of an automatic option could be a drawback. Also, the Focus' cabin design is getting dated compared to the other cars here. Starting MSRP with destination: $26,045 for the ST and $41,995 for the RS. 2018 is the last year for the RS, so it could very well be a future classic. Compared to a workaday Civic, the Type R hatchback is a monster. It has a turbocharged engine that produces 306 horsepower, a six-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension with adaptive shock absorbers, stronger brakes and more supportive front seats. Honda's engineers have seemingly made magic happen with the Type R. It has impressive composure on both the street and on a racetrack. The main drawbacks are the lack of an automatic transmission and, for some shoppers, the Type R's flamboyant styling. Starting MSRP with destination: $35,595 for the Type R hatchback. AND Hyundai's redesigned Veloster has one door on the driver side and two doors on the passenger side. This asymmetrical layout improves access for rear passengers while maintaining the look of a traditional coupe. The Veloster's Turbo variants come with a 201-horsepower engine and suspension and brake upgrades. You can also get a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Hyundai also has a new option for 2019: the Veloster N. The N gets a bigger turbocharged engine good for up to 275 horsepower plus additional hardware upgrades. Neither Veloster quite matches the performance potential of the other cars in this group, but their impressive features and low prices easily compensate for that. Starting MSRP with destination: $23,785 for the Veloster R-Spec. Hyundai hasn't officially priced the Veloster N, but we expect it to be around $30,000. Thanks to its petite size, pug nose and boxy profile, the Mini Hardtop is one of the most easily identifiable cars on the road. This playful two-door or four-door is graced with a style that harks back to the 1959 original, and you can customize it to a high degree with exterior and interior styling enhancements. To make the most of the Hardtop's performance, get the John Cooper Works version with its 228-horsepower turbocharged engine. The Mini Hardtop isn't as fast as some other cars here, but it's still a lot of fun to drive. Starting MSRP with destination: $33,250. AND VW created the first hot hatch in America with its 1983 GTI, and today's car is still one of the best. It packs a turbocharged 220-horsepower engine, and you can get it with a six-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. An adaptive suspension is also available to provide a greater range of comfort and handling potential. The Golf R takes everything about the GTI and makes it better. You get 292 horsepower, all-wheel drive, and just about all of the Golf's features as standard equipment. The Golf GTI and Golf R stand out among the cars on this list for their upscale and roomy cabins. VW also offers more advanced driver safety aids than Ford or Honda, which could be appealing to some shoppers. But the maximum performance potential of the Golf R isn't quite as high as that of the Civic Type R or Focus RS. You also typically have to pay more for a Golf. Starting MSRP with destination: $27,310 for the Golf S and $40,680 for the Golf R.

1598,"FINANCIAL MARKETS Asian stock markets gain after Wall Street rally BEIJING (AP) — Asian stocks rose Monday after Wall Street rallied as investors looked ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman's congressional testimony this week for insights into its economic outlook. On Friday, Wall Street capped several days of choppy trading with a rally that gave the stock market a modest gain for the week. Technology companies, banks and health care stocks accounted for much of the market's gains. Energy companies also rose along with crude oil prices. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 1.6 percent to 2,747.30. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 1.4 percent to 25,309.99. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.8 percent to 7,337.39. Investors are watching Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony Tuesday for insight into the Fed's outlook. Private sector analysts expect few significant changes in forecasts U.S. inflation will rise toward its 2 percent target and wage growth will stay moderate. Some traders are looking for the Fed to affirm a gradual pace of one interest rate hike per quarter this year. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose but remains just below $64 per barrel. The dollar declined against the yen and the euro. SUPREME COURT-UNION FEES Justices take up critical challenge to public sector unions WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that could deal a painful financial blow to organized labor. All eyes will be on Justice Neil Gorsuch Monday when the court takes up a challenge to an Illinois law that allows unions representing government employees to collect fees from workers who choose not to join. The unions say the outcome could affect more than 5 million government workers in 24 states and the District of Columbia. The court split 4-4 the last time it considered the issue in 2016. Gorsuch joined the court in April and has yet to weigh in on union fees. Organized labor is a big supporter of Democratic candidates and interests. Unions strongly opposed Gorsuch's nomination by President Donald Trump. Illinois government employee Mark Janus says he has a constitutional right not to contribute anything to a union with which he disagrees. Janus and the conservative interests that back him contend that everything unions representing public employees do is political, including contract negotiations. The Trump administration is supporting Janus in his effort to persuade the court to overturn its 1977 ruling allowing states to require fair share fees for government employees. The unions argue that so-called fair share fees pay for collective bargaining and other work the union does on behalf of all employees, not just its members. People can't be compelled to contribute to unions' political activities. The American Civil Liberties Union is on the unions' side against an individual's free speech claims. ACLU Legal Director David Cole said fair share fees do not violate nonunion workers' rights. Labor leaders fear that not only would workers who don't belong to a union stop paying fees, but that some union members might decide to stop paying dues if they could in essence get the union's representation for free. TRANSPORTATION-SAFETY RULES AP Review: Trump's red tape cuts slice into safety rules WASHINGTON (AP) — On a clear, dry June evening in 2015, cars and trucks rolled slowly in a herky-jerky backup ahead of an Interstate 75 construction zone in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Barreling toward them: an 18-ton tractor-trailer going about 80 mph. Despite multiple signs warning of slow traffic, the driver, with little or no braking, bashed into eight vehicles before coming to a stop about 1½ football fields away. Six people died in the mangled wreck and four more were hurt. The driver was convicted of vehicular homicide and other charges last month. In response to this and similar crashes, the government in 2016 proposed requiring that new heavy trucks have potentially life-saving software that would electronically limit speeds. But now, like many other safety rules in the works before President Donald Trump took office, it has been delayed indefinitely by the Transportation Department as part of a sweeping retreat from regulations that the president says slow the economy. An Associated Press review of the department's rulemaking activities in Trump's first year in office shows at least a dozen safety rules that were under development or already adopted have been repealed, withdrawn, delayed or put on the back burner. In most cases, those rules are opposed by powerful industries. And the political appointees running the agencies that write the rules often come from the industries they regulate. Meanwhile, there have been no significant new safety rules adopted over the same period. BUSINESS ECONOMISTS SURVEY Most in survey see US fiscal policy as too aggressive WASHINGTON (AP) — A majority of business economists now view the government's tax and spending policy as moving too aggressively to stimulate economic growth, setting up a potential increase in the deficit in the coming years, a new survey shows. That view emerged from the latest economic policy survey by the National Association for Business Economics, polling 211 members at companies and industry groups. The survey by NABE, a professional association for business economists, academics and others who use economics in the workplace, was released Monday. The 52 percent of economists who consider the government's fiscal policy ""too stimulative"" compares with only 20 percent in August, in the previous economic policy survey. This time, 37 percent of respondents judged tax and spending policy as ""about right,"" down from 46 percent in August. By contrast, the economists are more supportive of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy: more than 6 in 10 have pegged it as ""about right."" That's the highest percentage in eight years, according to NABE. The NABE economists, reflecting the prevailing view of corporate America, continue to have a strong preference for more conservative fiscal policy in the long run. ECONOMY-THE WEEK AHEAD Business and economic reports scheduled for release this week: WASHINGTON (AP) — Various reports related to housing are among the bulk of major economic data to be released this week. The Commerce Department reports today on new home sales for January. Tomorrow, Standard & Poor's releases S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices for December.

GAS PRICES Average price of US gas falls 6 cents, to $2.59 a gallon CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) — The average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline dropped about 6 cents nationally over the past two weeks, to $2.59. Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that it's the first decline since December. She says prices are expected to rise again as crude oil costs go up. The current gas price is 26 cents above where it was a year ago. Gas in San Francisco was the highest in the contiguous United States at an average of $3.38 a gallon. The lowest was in Jackson, Mississippi, at $2.23 a gallon. TOYOTA HYUNDAI RECALLS Toyota, Hyundai recall roughly 110,000 vehicles NEW YORK (AP) — Toyota and Hyundai have recalled roughly a combined 110,000 trucks and sport utility vehicles, including the 2018 Toyota Tundra and Sequoia, and the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport. In its recall announced Saturday, Hyundai says some of Santa Fe vehicles are at risk for the steering wheel breaking away from the steering column. Roughly 43,900 vehicles are included in Hyundai's recall. Toyota recalled roughly 64,900 Tundras and Sequoias, saying these vehicles are at risk for having their electronic stability control systems shutting down unexpectedly. Both car makers will notify impacted owners of the recalled vehicles starting in March, and if necessary, will repair the vehicles at no cost. For more information on the recalls, visit .

Hyundai's labor union said Tuesday that South Korea's government gave in to U.S. President Donald Trump at a time when the American market represents big opportunities. Kia's labor union said it shares that view. Hyundai said in a statement that it hoped the two governments would work together to defuse trade tensions. South Korea and the U.S. agreed to push back the earlier agreed-to elimination of import tariffs on pick-up trucks by 20 years to 2041.

1609,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Commerce Department sought feedback on President Donald Trump's plans to consider taxing auto imports. It got an earful at an all-day hearing Thursday. Critics lined up to urge the administration to reject auto tariffs. They argued that the taxes would raise car prices, squeeze automakers by increasing the cost of imported components and invite retaliation from U.S. trading partners — and allies — like the European Union and Canada. Jennifer Thomas of the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers registered her organization's opposition to levies on car, truck and auto parts imports. She noted that ""our view is shared by over 2,200 comments that were filed before this hearing. In fact, we were only able to find three organizations"" in favor of pursuing the tariffs. Trump has ordered Commerce to investigate whether auto imports pose a threat to U.S. national security that would justify tariffs or other trade restrictions. Earlier this year, he used national security as a justification for taxing imported steel and aluminum. Auto tariffs would escalate global trade tension dramatically: The U.S. last year imported $192 billion in vehicles and $143 billion in auto parts — figures that dwarf last year's $29 billion in steel and $23 billion in aluminum imports. Not to mention the $34 billion in Chinese goods the administration has so far hit with tariffs in yet another dispute over the predatory practices China deploys in a push to challenge U.S. high-tech dominance. Nearly 98 percent of the cars and trucks that would be hit by the tariffs are imported from U.S. allies: the EU, Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. David O'Sullivan, the EU's ambassador to Washington, said it was ""absurd"" to think that imports from staunch allies undermine America's national defense. In a study out Thursday, the Center for Automotive Research found that a 25 percent tariff on autos and parts would cut U.S. auto sales by 2 million and wipe out 714,700 jobs. It would also raise the price of the typical new car sold in the United States (now about $35,000) by $4,400 — $2,270 for U.S.-built cars and $6,875 for imported cars and trucks. ""New tariffs or quotas would also reduce competition and consumer choice; increase the cost of used vehicles; and raise the cost of getting vehicles serviced and repaired,"" said Peter Welch, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, which commissioned the study. Welch said the tariffs would push the average new-car payment to $611 a month from $533 a month (over 69 months on average). John Hall, a maintenance worker at the Hyundai Motor Manufacturing plant in Montgomery, Alabama, testified that auto imports pose no threat to U.S. national security. ""In fact, it's just the opposite,"" he said. Hyundai imports parts that go into its Alabama-built cars. ""New tariffs on automotive imports would have a devastating effect,"" Hall said. ""I am one of thousands of American workers whose livelihoods would be put at risk by a substantial tariff on automotive goods. It would not be possible to change our supply chain overnight, and a 25 percent tariff on parts would raise production costs at our Alabama factory by about 10 percent annually."" ___ Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at",2672,2678,Auto Brand,167

Other media companies are rallying as investors hope for more deals. HOME SALES US home sales fell 0.4 percent in May amid inventory crunch WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. existing home sales slipped 0.4 percent in May, as the prolonged shortage of properties on the market is deterring home-buying. The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.43 million in May, the second straight monthly decline. Sales have tumbled 3 percent over the past year, despite steady job growth that has boosted demand from would-be homebuyers as the unemployment rate has fallen to a multi-decade low of 3.8 percent. The housing market is caught in a vice grip of fewer sales listings and rising mortgage rates, both of which have made home ownership less affordable for many Americans. FEDERAL RESERVE-POWELL Fed chair signals gradual rate hikes in tame inflation era WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the Fed will likely keep raising short-term interest rates at a gradual pace, partly because there are few signs, so far, that the ultra-low U.S. unemployment rate is pushing up inflation. In a speech in Portugal, Powell said Wednesday that with the unemployment rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent and inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target, the case for continued gradual increases in rates ""is strong."" Low unemployment historically has pushed up inflation as companies raise prices so they can pay more to keep workers. But Powell noted that the sharp drop in unemployment since the recession has occurred ""without much apparent reaction from inflation."" That suggests the Fed is less likely to accelerate rate hikes pre-emptively to forestall inflation. Powell's remarks at a central banking forum come just a week after the Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate for the second time this year. Fed policymakers signaled they will likely hike rates twice more this year. EUROPE-US TARIFFS EU says it will start to impose tariffs on US on Friday BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union will start imposing duties on a list of U.S. products as of Friday in response to President Donald Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe. The 28-nation EU was first expected to do so only next month but EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said they would  introduce ""rebalancing"" tariffs on about 2.8 billion euros' ($3.4 billion) worth of U.S. products this week. The targets include steel, agricultural and other products, including bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. Malmstrom said that ""we are left with no other choice."" Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum from the EU on June 1. Europeans claim it is simply protectionism and breaks global trade rules. TRADE DISPUTES-CENTRAL BANK CONCERNS Central bank chiefs of 4 major nations raise trade concerns WASHINGTON (AP) — The leaders of the central banks of four major economies are expressing alarm that multiple trade conflicts are threatening to slow global growth. The officials say the escalating trade fights involving the United States, China and Europe could erode business confidence, lead companies to delay investment and hurt the global economy. The central bank leaders add, though, that so far there's scant evidence that this has happened yet. ""What's the effect on confidence?"" European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says at a conference in Portugal. ""What's the effect on business investment? There are lessons from the past, and they are all very negative."" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell notes that the Fed has heard of businesses postponing investment and hiring, and ""those concerns seem to be rising."" VOLVO-NEW VEHICLE Volvo watches tariffs as 1st US plant opens RIDGEVILLE, S.C. (AP) — Volvo is showing off its first car to be made-in-America, even as the economic climate changes radically under President Donald Trump. Volvo Cars officially opened its South Carolina plant Wednesday with a glitzy ceremony that revealed the Swedish automaker's redesigned S60 hybrid-powered sedan, which will roll off the assembly line this fall. But the auto market has changed considerably since Volvo announced in 2015 it would build its first U.S. plant in Ridgeville. President Donald Trump was elected in 2016 and is threatening tariffs that could impact foreign carmakers. Volvo executives say they want to end all tariffs between the U.S. and Europe and China, where Volvo's owners are based. The executives say they are watching Trump carefully to react if his decisions affect their company. NEW CAR QUALITY Automakers improve quality to record level in annual survey DETROIT (AP) — A survey of new-vehicle buyers finds that car and truck quality hit a record high this year as automakers started to clear up bugs with infotainment systems. The annual survey by J.D. Power finds that buyers reported a record-low 93 problems per 100 vehicles during the first three months of ownership, four problems fewer than last year. The survey also found that Korean brands Genesis, Kia and Hyundai claimed the top three spots for the first time in new vehicle quality. Porsche and Ford rounded out the top five. J.D. Power also found that the Detroit three improved their quality faster than the industry as a whole. Fiat Chrysler knocked off seven problems, while Ford and General Motors each dropped five. The lowest-ranking brands were Land Rover, Jaguar and Volvo. SKOREA-HYUNDAI MOTOR-AUDI Hyundai Motor, Audi join hands for fuel cell technology SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group says it has signed an agreement with Audi AG to jointly develop electronics vehicles powered by fuel cell. Under the multi-year agreement signed Wednesday, Hyundai's affiliates including Kia and Audi's parent company Volkswagen AG will share components, supply chains and patent licensing. The duration of the partnership wasn't disclosed. Hyundai, the world's fifth-largest automaker, began to mass produce fuel cell vehicles in 2013. But in South Korea and elsewhere, wider adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles has been slow largely due to a dearth of refueling stations. South Korea's government plans to add more hydrogen refueling stations to increase electronics vehicle sales and reduce carbon emissions. BATTLE FOR FOX Disney ups Twenty-First Century Fox to more than $71B NEW YORK (AP) — Disney is offering more than $71 billion for Fox's entertainment businesses in a counterbid to Comcast's nearly $66 billion offer. The battle for Twenty-First Century Fox reflects a new imperative among entertainment and telecommunications firms. They are amassing ever more programming to better compete with technology companies such as Amazon and Netflix for viewers' attention — and dollars. The deal would include Fox film and TV studios, some cable networks and international assets, but not Fox News Channel or the Fox television network. AT&T just bought Time Warner for $81 billion, after a federal judge rejected the government's antitrust concerns. Disney offered more than $52 billion in December, at $28 per Fox share. It's now offering $38. Comcast's bid was for $35.

1726,DETROIT (AP) — Kia is recalling over a half-million vehicles in the U.S. because the air bags may not work in a crash. The recall apparently is related to federal investigation into air bag failures in Kia and partner Hyundai vehicles that were linked to four deaths. Vehicles covered by the recall include 2010 through 2013 Forte compact cars and 2011 through 2013 Optima midsize cars. Also covered are Optima Hybrid and Sedona minivans from 2011 and 2012. A Hyundai spokesman says he's checking to see if his company has a recall. Kia says it's working on a remedy and will notify owners June 27. Kia says in government documents that a short circuit can develop in an air bag control computer. The company has not yet developed a repair.,218,224,Auto Brand,92

The panel sent the case back to the judge to conduct that analysis and also exclude used car owners from the deal. Hyundai and Kia announced in 2012 that they were lowering their fuel efficiency estimates for approximately 900,000 vehicles from model years 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Car sales are expected to hit a record low this year after steadily declining for several years. SUVs surpassed cars for the first time in 2016, and the gap only widens.

13,"FINANCIAL MARKETS Asian shares mostly higher, defying Facebook-led tech slump BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher early Friday as investors shrugged off Facebook's nearly $120 billion plunge in market value, the biggest-ever one-day loss in dollar value for a U.S. company. Facebook's tumble, brought on by its warning to investors that it sees slower revenue growth ahead, led a decline in technology shares and snapped a three-day winning streak for the S&P 500 index, which lost 0.3 percent to 2,837.44. The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, lost 80.05 points, or 1 percent, to 7,852.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose 30 members don't include Facebook, had a much better day, rising 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 0.6 percent to 1,695.36. More stocks rose than fell on the New York Stock Exchange. The agreement between President Donald Trump and a European delegation to work on a pact to dismantle trade barrier inspired fresh optimism among investors that trade tensions between the U.S and European Union may be on the mend. But it's worrying for Asian trading partners, especially China, which could lose leverage with Washington in its own disputes, especially over its imports of soybeans. The Bank of Japan is due to hold a policy meeting early next week that some analysts believe could bring at least minor changes to the longstanding ultra-lax monetary policy for the world's third-largest economy. Sustained relatively strong growth has raised expectations that the central bank may need to consider further tempering its massive purchases of government bonds and other assets. Benchmark U.S. crude oil inched ahead to remain above $69.50 per barrel. The dollar slipped against the yen and the euro. US-CHINA TARIFFS China: Qualcomm failed to resolve anti-monopoly worries BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government says Qualcomm Inc. failed to resolve China's anti-monopoly concerns about its proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, in a case analysts warned would worsen escalating U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology. The State Administration for Market Regulation's announcement followed a government denial Thursday that a lengthy anti-monopoly review, which prompted Qualcomm to drop its bid this week, was linked to Beijing's tariff dispute with Washington. Qualcomm's plan for the $44 billion acquisition ""cannot resolve competition concerns,"" the regulator said on its website. It gave no details. The delay following U.S. and European approval prompted suggestions Beijing might be using the case as leverage in its spiraling dispute with Washington. Beijing's failure to approve the deal ""will escalate trade tensions between the two countries,"" Eurasia Group said in a report. Qualcomm had described the bid for NXP, announced in 2016, as a way to expand into markets for automobiles, security and network processing. That would have created an even bigger global competitor to a fledgling Chinese semiconductor industry communist leaders are spending billions of dollars to develop. GENERAL MOTORS-TOO MANY FACTORIES GM faces fiscal, political conundrums as it assesses plants LORDSTOWN, Ohio (AP) — With too many factories making slow-selling cars, General Motors can't afford to keep them all operating without making some tough decisions. But the political atmosphere might be limiting its options. A possible scenario, analysts say, is to close its sprawling Lordstown plant in northeastern Ohio because the compact car it makes also is built in Mexico. The once-bustling factory already has lost two of its three shifts and 3,000 union jobs since the beginning of last year. But moving that car, the Chevrolet Cruze, south of the border brings the risk of provoking a backlash and tweetstorm from President Donald Trump. And GM also isn't sure whether he'll make good on threats to impose 25 percent tariffs on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico. Also at issue is that the Cruze plant just outside Youngtown is in a Democratic and labor stronghold, where Trump won over a surprising number of voters two years ago by reaching out to what he called America's ""forgotten men and women."" At a rally near the plant last summer, Trump talked about passing by big factories whose jobs ""have left Ohio,"" then told people not to sell their homes because the jobs are ""coming back. They're all coming back."" Altogether, GM has five car factories with plenty of unused capacity in Kansas City, Kansas; Lordstown; and Detroit-Hamtramck, Lansing, and Orion Township, Michigan. Three are running on one shift per day, which is inefficient and costs GM money. Automakers like to run plants on at least two daily shifts. To deal with the overcapacity, GM will either have to eat the added costs, close one or more plants, or retool them to build trucks and SUVs that now are favored by U.S. buyers. FACEBOOK-PRIVACY SCANDAL AFTERMATH-THE LATEST Facebook market value plunges $119 billion NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is reeling after experiencing its worst trading day since going public in 2012. The market value of the social media giant plunged $119 billion on Thursday. That's a 19 percent loss. The collapse comes a day after the company revealed that user growth has slowed, amid swirling questions about how Facebook's information is used. It was the company's worst trading day since going public in 2012, and among the biggest one-day losses of market value in U.S. stock market history. The loss came a day after Facebook revealed that its user base and revenue grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter as it grappled with privacy issues. Those revelations stunned investors, who believed the company had weathered the recent scandal over users' privacy and pushed the stock to an all-time high Wednesday of $217.50.

The average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.49 per share. The online retailer posted revenue of $52.89 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Fourteen analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $53.45 billion. For the current quarter ending in October, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $54 billion to $57.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $58.24 billion.

AP EXPLAINS-STATES RIGHTS Lawmakers and others in Democratic-learning states have been howling over the past year about actions by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that they say have undermined states' rights. That includes promoting concealed carry legislation and attacking sanctuary status for immigrants to this week's decisions on legalized marijuana and offshore oil drilling. But it wasn't too long ago that the shoe was on the other foot, with Republican states pushing back against the Obama administration's intrusions on issues such as transgender rights and environmental regulation. Promoting the constitutional protections for states' rights — outlined in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — has always been popular among politicians. But it also is situational.

24,"OCALA, Fla. (AP) — In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is blind, climbed into the driver's seat of a self-driving car and rolled up to the drive-thru of a Taco Bell in a video that's been viewed more than 8 million times online. The piece, produced by Google, captured the potential of autonomous-car technology to change the lives of the visually impaired. ""It was my first time behind the steering wheel in seven years and was absolutely amazing,"" Mahan said. Self-driving-car advocates say that in addition to helping the disabled, the vehicles will allow people to do other tasks while driving and  make roadways safer by removing human error. But six years after Google's viral video, national advocates for the estimated 1.3 million legally blind people in the U.S. are worried the industry is not factoring their needs into the design of the new technology, a mistake they say will make the cars more expensive and harder for them to access. ""Although we have been held up as obvious beneficiaries of the technology in conversations and presentations, this will have just been exploitation if the systems are not accessible,"" said Anil Lewis, executive director of the National Federation of the Blind's Jernigan Institute. ""How about instead of Taco Bell, we demonstrate a blind person independently operating an autonomous vehicle, dropping off his/her kids at school on the way to work, and maybe stopping by a Starbucks on the way?"" The concerns are fueling new research outside the auto industry to develop data and software meant to help ensure the needs of the blind are met when autonomous cars become commonplace. In a University of Florida study, blind people are using experimental software that could be easily installed in cars and peoples' phones. On a recent sunny winter day in central Florida, Sharon Van Etten eased into the backseat of an SUV and began speaking to a computer screen in front of her. ""Where do you want to go?"" the computer's voice responded. Van Etten, who is legally blind, said ""Kmart,"" and off the car sped, the computer's voice intoning, ""Central Christian Church on the left"" and other landmarks as they coasted down the street. When the driver pulled the car up to the store, the voice told Van Etten which side to exit from and mentioned some of the obstacles she'd face between the car and the store entrance. University of Florida researcher Julian Brinkley developed the program, which he has named ""Atlas."" Using data he collects from users like Van Etten and others through collaboration with the Florida Center for the Blind in Ocala, he's figuring out the specific needs blind people have using self-driving cars, and using his software to solve problems. ""If I'm a visually impaired person and I don't have the ability to verify visually that I'm at the appropriate location, how do I know that it's not dropping me off in a field somewhere?"" Brinkley said. ""In the case of autonomous cars, hopefully accessibility will be moved to the forefront by some of the research."" Brinkley doesn't have access to a self-driving vehicle so instead uses a process developed by Stanford University researchers in a specially configured conventional vehicle. Participants interact with vehicle-control software in what appears to be a self-driving vehicle, and the vehicle's driver, hidden behind a partition, uses instructions from the software to drive to the right place. Participants don't know that a human driver is at the controls. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory also are working on accessibility issues for driverless vehicles for blind and other people with disabilities. At Waymo, Google's self-driving-car company that started nearly a decade ago, officials say visually impaired employees contribute to design and research. While no specific system for blind riders has been completed, the company says it's developing a mobile app, Braille labels and audio cues. Spokespeople for General Motors Cruise AV group, Nissan North America Inc. and Toyota Research Institute all said the companies are committed to accessibility in general but offered no further comment. Mahan, the man famous for the YouTube video who still consults with Waymo, said he's cautiously optimistic. ""Autonomous vehicles aren't being designed for blind people; we're one of the beneficiaries of the technology,"" the 65-year-old said from his San Jose, California, home. ""They're working on it. I don't push. They expose me to what they're working on, and so I'm patiently waiting."" Autonomous-car industry analysts say the needs of disabled people are being discussed as designers figure out how users will interface with the cars, but there are many competing demands. ""They're trying to figure out what way to interface with these vehicles for riders, and to build a sense of trust about what the vehicles are doing,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Navigant Research in Detroit. ""But right now, I don't know if anyone has all the answers."" In the meantime, advocates for the blind have turned to Florida's Brinkley and other researchers to push development forward. Back in Ocala, Cinzhasha Farmer giggled nervously as the Atlas voice spoke to her. The 41-year-old was eager to participate in Brinkley's study so she can one day drive without relying on others. ""It's one of my goals, and I don't know how I'll ever accomplish it — but that car may do it,"" she said with a smile. ___ Associated Press writer Tamara Lush contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jason Dearen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen",4014,4027,Auto Brand,180

31,"BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group and the biggest Chinese SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, announced a partnership Tuesday to produce electric MINI vehicles in China as global automakers ramp up development under pressure from Beijing. The companies said they signed an agreement Monday during an event in Berlin attended by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. BMW and Great Wall said their venture, Spotlight Automotive Ltd., also will make electrics for the Chinese partner's brand. Great Wall put total investment in the venture at 5.1 billion yuan ($770 million) and said it is aiming for annual production of 160,000 vehicles. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Other automakers including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. have announced similar plans with Chinese partners to produce dozens of electric models. Great Wall, headquartered in Baoding, southwest of Beijing, sells more than 1 million SUVs a year. ""With our joint approach, we can quickly scale up production and increase efficiency,"" said Klaus Frolich, a BMW board member, in a statement. MINI's first battery electric model is due to be produced at its main British factory in Oxford in 2019, according to BMW. China is BMW's biggest market. The Munich-based automaker said about 560,000 BMW brand vehicles were delivered to Chinese customers in 2017, more than its next two markets —  the United States and Germany — combined. China was MINI's fourth-largest market in 2017, with 35,000 vehicles delivered, the company said. The electrics venture with BMW is an important boost for Great Wall, which industry analysts warned would struggle to satisfy Beijing's sales quotas due to its fuel-guzzling vehicle lineup and had yet to announce any significant electric plans. ___ BMW Group: www.bmwgroup.com Great Wall Motors Co.: www.gwm-global.com",1464,1477,Auto Brand,183

WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates continued to climb this week, reaching their highest level in more than four years and denting prospective home purchasers' prospects amid the spring buying season. It was the third straight week of increases for long-term mortgage rates. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 4.58 percent from 4.47 percent last week. By contrast, the benchmark rate averaged 4.03 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans rose to 4.02 percent from 3.94 percent last week. Spiking rates on U.S. Treasury bonds, driven by rising commodity prices, helped lift long-term mortgage rates to their highest level since August 2013. DURABLE GOODS US durable goods orders up 2.6 percent in March WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose 2.6 percent in March, but a key category that tracks business investment spending fell for the third month out of the past four. The Commerce Department says the big rise in orders for durable goods, which followed an even bigger 3.5 percent advance in February, was driven by a surge in demand for commercial aircraft. That shot up 44.5 percent last month. Excluding the volatile transportation category, orders would have been flat last month after a modest 0.9 percent rise in February. The key category that follows business investment plans edged down 0.1 percent in March after a 0.9 percent increase in February. This investment category was also down in January and December, raising concerns about this important driver of economic growth. EARNS-AMERICAN AIRLINES American Airlines CEO warns that higher fares are coming DALLAS (AP) — Rising fuel costs are eating into airline profits, dampening expectations for the rest of 2018, and setting the stage for higher fares. American Airlines is blaming higher fuel prices for a 45 percent drop in first-quarter profit, to $186 million. The world's biggest airline has cut its forecast of earnings for the year. CEO Doug Parker says fuel is the airlines' second-biggest expense after labor, so when it rises, so does the cost of providing air travel. He says fuel was up 40 cents a gallon from a year ago. EARNS-SOUTHWEST AIRLINES Bookings for Southwest fall after fatal accident DALLAS (AP) — Southwest Airlines says bookings are down since the fatal accident on one of its planes last week. The company said Thursday that it expects revenue per mile, which tracks average prices, will drop between 1 percent and 3 percent in the April-through-June quarter. It said that 1 to 2 percentage points of the decline is due to slower sales since the April 17 accident. A Southwest flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after an engine failed, fatally injuring a passenger. It was the first accident-related death of a passenger in the airline's 47-year history. Southwest disclosed the weaker bookings as it reported a 22 percent increase in first-quarter profit, to $463 million. The results were in line with Wall Street expectations. EARNS-GENERAL MOTORS GM 1Q earnings fall 60 pct. but company beats estimates DETROIT (AP) — General Motors' first-quarter net income fell 60 percent from a year ago, but the company handily beat Wall Street estimates as U.S. sales rose. The Detroit automaker says it made just over $1 billion from January through March, or 77 cents per share. A year ago the company made $2.6 billion, or $1.70 per share. But excluding one-time costs such as restructuring in South Korea, the company made $1.43 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $1.24. Revenue fell 3 percent to $36.1 billion. Analysts predicted $34.5 billion. GM says earnings and revenue fell because shipments to dealers dropped as factories were closed to retool for new full-size pickup trucks. But GM's U.S. sales from dealers to buyers rose 3.8 percent. EARNS-FIAT CHRYSLER Fiat Chrysler reports 60 percent rise in profits MILAN (AP) — Carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has reported a 60 percent rise in net profit for the first quarter of 2018. The company said Thursday that its profit of 1.02 billion euros ($1.24 billion) was up from 641 million euros in the same quarter a year earlier, though net revenue edged down 2 percent to 27.03 billion euros. Fiat Chrysler maintained its guidance for full-year earnings, saying it still expects net revenue of about 125 billion euros. The carmaker said it shipped 1.2 million vehicles in the first quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier. The boost was mainly due to improved sales in North and Latin America and a jump at its Jeep unit. EARNS-UNITED PARCEL SERVICE UPS earnings beat expectations ATLANTA (AP) — More deliveries and higher revenue per package boosted first-quarter profit at UPS, but the company was hampered by rising costs as it upgrades its network to keep up with online shopping. United Parcel Service Inc. said Thursday that it earned $1.35 billion in the quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier. The results topped analysts' forecasts, and the shares rose in midday trading. Revenue grew by 10 percent, with double-digit gains in the Atlanta company's international and freight businesses and a smaller pickup in the core U.S. package-delivery unit. Operating profit fell, however, in the domestic-package business, which UPS blamed on bad weather, the startup of Saturday service, and investments in new facilities and automation to help meet the growing demand for delivery of online purchases by consumers.

(AP) — Ford will shed most of its North American car lineup as part of broad plan to save money and make the company more competitive in a fast-changing marketplace, one that includes a dramatic shift toward trucks and SUVs in the U.S. The changes include getting rid of all cars in the region during the next four years except for the Mustang sports car and a compact Focus crossover vehicle. Ford will no longer sell the Fusion midsize car, Taurus large car, CMax hybrid compact and Fiesta subcompact in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Ford says its net income rose slightly in the first quarter due largely to a lower income tax rate. The automaker says it made $1.74 billion, or 43 cents per share, compared with $1.59 billion, or 40 cents per share a year ago. Revenue rose 7 percent to $41.96 billion. Ford also says it has found another $11.5 billion in cost cuts and efficiencies.

The board did not immediately respond to the government, but has said it would consider going to court to implement various measures if needed. VENEZUELA-CONOCOPHILLIPS ConocoPhillips wins $2 billion arbitration against Venezuela CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — ConocoPhillips says it won a $2 billion arbitration award against Venezuela's state oil company over the seizure a decade ago of investments in two projects in the OPEC nation. The award represents the equivalent of more than 20 percent of the cash-strapped Venezuelan government's foreign currency reserves. The Houston-based company said in a statement that the ruling against PDVSA was made by an international tribunal constituted under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. It said the award is final and binding and that it intends to seek financial recovery of the award to the full extent of the law.

VOLKSWAGEN-EMISSIONS SETTLEMENT-MARYLAND Maryland reaches $33.5 million settlement with Volkswagen UNFDATED (AP) — Maryland has reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with Volkswagen AG and two of its affiliates for using devices in cars that violated the state's environmental laws. Under the settlement announced Wednesday, the auto manufacturers will pay a $29.5 million penalty. They also agreed to choose a Maryland-based port facility to provide support to Volkswagen operations valued at $4.5 million. If the automakers don't meet that part of the agreement, they'll have to pay an additional $4.5 million. The ""defeat devices"" installed in vehicles enabled them to pass emissions tests. But under actual driving conditions, vehicles with the devices installed emitted up to 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide. Maryland Secretary of the Environment Ben Grumbles says the settlement is a ""silver lining"" of the Volkswagen scandal. The state filed the lawsuit against Volkswagen in July 2016.

JOB OPENINGS US job openings slip in May, as quits reach 17-year high WASHINGTON (AP) — Businesses advertised fewer jobs in May than the previous month, but the tally of open positions outnumbered the ranks of the unemployed for only the second time in the past two decades. The Labor Department also says the proportion of workers quitting their jobs reached the highest level since April 2001. Quits are seen as a positive sign that workers are confident they can find another job. Most people who quit do so for higher-paying positions. The figures reflect a strong job market driven by optimistic employers seeking to expand their workforces. Last week's jobs report showed that businesses hired workers at a healthy pace and the unemployment rate remained very low, at 4 percent. There were 6.64 million available jobs in May, but just 6 million unemployed people. CHINA-TARIFFS China announces anti-dumping duties BEIJING (AP) — China has stepped up action against some U.S. goods by announcing anti-dumping duties on raw materials used in making optical fibers. The Commerce Ministry says optical fiber preforms from the United States will face additional duties of 37.9 to 78.2 percent for five years. It said Corning was among the companies that would be affected by the higher duties. TRUMP-CLIMATE PLAN Trump replacement for Obama climate plan moves forward BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Trump administration is advancing its plan to replace the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts against global warming with a new rule expected to be friendlier to the coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency said it sent the new rule to the White House for review on Monday. The document itself was not released. The move coincided with former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler's first day at the helm of the EPA following last week's resignation of Administrator Scott Pruitt. Obama sought to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, largely by reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants. Under Trump, the EPA declared the old rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. CHINA-TESLA Tesla announces deal for Shanghai factory UNDATED (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla says it will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai. Tesla says an agreement signed Tuesday with a Shanghai city government agency calls for construction to start in the near future. It says production would begin three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. The announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese trade tensions and follows Beijing's decision in April to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through joint ventures with local partners. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market. Automakers are investing heavily to develop models to appeal to local customers. CHINA-BMW-ELECTRIC MINI BMW to make electric MINIs in China with Great Wall Motor BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group and China's biggest SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, have announced a partnership to produce electric MINI vehicles in China. Tuesday's announcement comes as automakers pour billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology, under pressure from Beijing to accelerate development. BMW and Great Wall said the venture also will produce electric vehicles under the Chinese partner's brand. Other automakers including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. have announced similar plans with local partners to produce dozens of electric models for China. ISRAEL-LUNAR MISSION Israeli company plans lunar landing next year YEHUD, Israel (AP) — An Israeli company says it will soon attempt to become the first private entity to land a spacecraft on the moon. SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries plan to launch their unmanned module in December, the teams announced Tuesday. If it succeeds, Israel will become the fourth country to land on the moon, after the U.S., the Soviet Union and China. The $95 million project, largely funded by South African-Israeli billionaire Morris Kahn and other donors, aims to land on the moon on Feb. 13. Kahn said if they pull off the moonshot it would be ""a tremendous achievement."" SpaceIL originally vied for Google's Lunar Xprize, but the $20 million competition was scrapped in March after none of the companies met the deadline. CUBA-PRIVATE-BUSINESS Cuba unfreezing growth of private tourism businesses HAVANA (AP) — The Cuban government will allow new restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and transportation businesses by the end of the year, reopening the most vibrant sectors of the private economy after freezing growth for more than a year. The government is unveiling a set of new regulations meant to control the growth of tourism-related private businesses and collect more tax revenue from them. Private restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts boomed after U.S.-Cuba normalization in 2014 prompted rapid growth in tourism to Cuba. Tax evasion and purchase of stolen state materials also boomed in the mostly cash-based private hospitality sector. Among other measures, the new regulations announced Tuesday require private businesses to move all their revenue through state-run bank accounts. Cuba froze new licenses for restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and other key business in August 2017. TEMPLE BUSINESS SCHOOL-FALSIFIED RANKINGS Temple business school dean forced out over falsified data PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The dean of Temple University's business school has been forced out over falsified data submitted to rankings organizations about its online master's program. Temple president Richard Englert says in an email that Moshe Porat was asked to resign on Monday. Porat refused, but the university says he no longer heads the school. He still retains a teaching appointment. In January, the Fox School of Business reported it had submitted inaccurate data to U.S. News & World Report. As a result, the publication removed the school's No. 1 online MBA program ranking. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES-PEANUTS Ending a long tradition, Southwest will stop serving peanuts UNDATED (AP) — Southwest Airlines will stop giving away peanuts on flights next month, ending a tradition that goes back decades. The airline said Tuesday it was pulling peanuts from all flights because of concern for passengers with peanut allergies. They will be replaced by pretzels and, on some longer flights, other free snacks. Southwest says the decision follows months of deliberation and isn't tied to any particular incident involving passengers with allergies. No snack is more closely identified with a U.S. airline. Over the years, Southwest used the humble legume in marketing campaigns. A blog on its website is called Nuts About Southwest. Some of Southwest's other early quirks, like dressing flight attendants in hot pants, went out decades ago, but the peanuts survived. Until now.",3970,3983,Auto Brand,187
77,"NEW YORK (AP) — Takata Corp's U.S. unit has reached a settlement with representatives of those injured by lethally defective air bags, paving the way for the company to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy and move forward with a reorganization plan, according to court documents. The agreement between the Japanese auto parts suppliers, injured drivers and creditors, was outlined in documents filed in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Two groups representing people suing over the air bags have dropped their opposition to the restructuring plan, according to the documents filed on Saturday. Under the settlement, lawsuits will be resolved through a trust fund. Takata was forced into bankruptcy amid lawsuits, multimillion-dollar fines and crushing recall costs involving the air bags. Key to the restructuring plan is the planned sale of most of its assets to a Chinese-owned rival for $1.6 billion. Takata's air bag inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 16 people have died and more than 180 have been injured due to the problem, which has touched off the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history. At least 42 million vehicles and as many as 69 million inflators have been recalled in the U.S. More than 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. Thirteen automakers have joined the agreement, including General Motors and Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. The manufacturers, which are both Takata's largest customers and biggest creditors, are indemnified in their agreements with Takata from losses and liabilities related to the air bag inflators. Takata will file an amended version of the reorganization plan in court, according to the documents. A spokesman for Takata said the company had no comment on the settlement.",1377,1390,Auto Brand,188
95,"DETROIT (AP) — Among the many shiny models vying for attention at Detroit's North American International Auto Show are the revamped Volkswagen Jetta, Hyundai Veloster and Kia Forte. But cars — particularly small ones — are having a tough time getting buyers to look their way as SUVs grow in popularity. Car sales are expected to hit a record low this year after steadily declining for several years. SUVs surpassed cars for the first time in 2016, and the gap only widens: Auto shopping site Edmunds.com forecasts the utilities will make up 43.5 percent of new vehicle sales this year, while cars will fall to 34.5 percent. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) The reasons are plenty, including relatively low gas prices, growing millennial families and small, attractive SUV models that are becoming more fuel efficient and affordable. The small car slump and utility boom has spurred industry changes: Ford is converting a Michigan plant that currently makes the Focus for Bronco SUV production. The automaker plans to move Focus production to China. So why the big push to make — and market — cars as the demand dwindles? There are economies of scale, since many cars are sold globally, including in overseas markets where small cars are more popular. Then there's the ""gateway"" effect, according to Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car buying site Autotrader.com. ""A small car is likely the first new vehicle a young person buys,"" she said in an email. ""So it is particularly important to make a good impression so that person sticks with a brand and moves up the size and price ladder."" Despite the sales drops, the U.S. small car category is still ""huge,"" Krebs said, representing 2.1 million last year and the fourth largest vehicle segment. Still, there's no question that several car-dependent manufacturers have been hurt by the shift to SUVs, including VW, Hyundai and Kia. The models being showcased in Detroit are examples of ""what they have to work with while they develop more sport-utilities,"" Krebs said. Hyundai isn't giving up on small cars, as evidenced by the new Veloster. It also recently revealed the updated Accent subcompact, which has some surprising optional features like remote start, which lets the driver start the car with a smartphone, and a hands-free trunk that opens when the driver waves a foot under it. ""We still believe there's big demand for basic transportation that offers more,"" said Michael O'Brien, who leads U.S. product planning for Kia, Hyundai's smaller affiliate. Underscoring the point, Kia said the Forte had its best sales year in 2017 — the last year before the redesigned model debuted at the Detroit show. Even though small cars have fallen out of favor in the U.S. now, automakers still need to invest in them due to demand in other parts of the world, says Mark Reuss, General Motors' global product development chief. Also, Reuss says he's seen events that have rapidly shifted what consumers want, and he wants to be ready if that happens. ""These are long-term capital investments,"" Reuss said. ""Some of the big shocks that have happened that I've seen in my career flip things pretty quick, faster than we can change capital investments."" Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, says customers looking for an affordable vehicle last year were more likely to shop for used SUVs over new small cars. But small cars are still an important part of the market, he says, especially in cities where people need something small and maneuverable. Sales of new small cars also spiked after the hurricanes in Florida and Texas, when people who needed transportation quickly went for the most affordable cars they could find. ""There's a place for the compact car,"" he said. ""There's a place for value."" ___ AP auto writers Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin contributed to this story. ___ Follow Jeff Karoub on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffkaroub.

97,"BEIJING (AP) — Facing the risk of a trade fight with the United States, China announced plans Tuesday to allow full foreign ownership of automakers in five years. The change would scrap rules that require global automakers to work through state-owned partners — an arrangement that forces those foreign companies to share technology with potential competitors in China. It was unclear whether Beijing's action might mollify U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to slap tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods in response to complaints that Beijing pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. The possibility of a trade war between the world's two largest economies has shaken financial markets and could threaten the steady economic growth that is buoying most of the regions of the world. ""If you keep poking at the economic expansion, it could turn around and bite you,"" Maurice Obstfeld, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, told reporters Tuesday as the IMF issued its latest forecast for global growth. There aren't ""going to be any winners coming out of a trade war."" The lending agency kept its forecast for global economic growth this year at 3.9 percent, which would be the fastest pace since 2011. But Obstfeld warned that that bright outlook depends on avoiding a major trade conflict. In China, the move to open the auto industry reflects growing official confidence in the country's young but fast-growing automakers and a desire to make the industry more flexible as Beijing promotes the development of electric cars. Automakers had been awaiting details since President Xi Jinping announced last week that ownership restrictions would be eased and auto import duties reduced. Some analysts saw Xi's promise as an attempt to placate Trump. But Chinese government spokespeople said the plans had nothing to do with Beijing's trade dispute with Washington. Tuesday's announcement coincided with a Commerce Ministry order to importers of U.S. sorghum to post bonds to pay possible anti-dumping duties in a separate dispute. It said preliminary results of a trade inquiry had found that U.S. sorghum, a grain used as animal feed and in liquor distilling, was sold at improperly low prices that hurt Chinese farmers. In the meantime, limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers will be eliminated this year, the Cabinet's planning agency said. That change will be followed by a similar repeal for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020 and for passenger vehicles in 2022. ""Following a five-year transition period, all ownership restrictions will be lifted,"" said the announcement by the National Development and Reform Commission. Until now, such major global automakers as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG have been allowed to own no more than 50 percent of a joint venture with a Chinese partner. And they were limited to two ventures. Foreign automakers complied as the necessary price to access to China's populous market, which passed the United States in 2009 as the world's biggest by number of vehicles sold. Sales of sedans, SUVs and minivans last year totaled 24.8 million units. About 55 percent of them were American, European, Japanese and Korean brands. Some Chinese-foreign automotive joint ventures go back more than two decades. General Motors, for instance, started its Chinese operations in 1997. It now sells more than 4 million vehicles annually there — more than it sells in any other market, including in the United States. GM sells vehicles under five brand names in China — Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Baojun and Wuling — and is traditionally among the two top-selling companies there. The company could enjoy a big financial boost if it manages to shed its Chinese partners. Last year, the Detroit company made $1.95 billion off its 50 percent equity stake in China. It's unlikely that foreign automakers would sever themselves completely from their Chinese partners even after the phase-in period, said Jeff Schuster of the consulting firm LMC Automotive near Detroit. ""It's difficult to unwind; you've already got the relationships established,"" Schuster said. But Schuster does envision the U.S. and other foreign automakers reducing the size of their Chinese partners' ownership stakes and separating their intellectual property from those partners. ""You could see (autonomous vehicle) development peel away from the joint venture partner,"" he said. ""It all comes down to balancing your risk over your intellectual property against the cost of developing on your own."" Independent Chinese brands such as Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo Cars, SUV maker Great Wall and electric car brand BYD Auto, are developing technology and increasing exports. Geely has bought a nearly 10 percent stake in Daimler AG, becoming the German automaker's biggest shareholder and gaining leverage to push for technology sharing. State-owned Dongfeng Motor Group, which has joint ventures with Nissan Motor Co. and other brands, bought a 14 percent stake in France's PSA Peugeot Citroen in 2014. ""Chinese companies such as Geely and Great Wall have financial power and technology resources,"" said industry analyst John Zeng of LMC Automotive. ""It's not like 10 years ago, when foreign brands had a big technology advantage."" He said the latest shift is part of Beijing's effort to accelerate development of electric vehicles, which have a central role in the ruling Communist Party's industry plans. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market, with last year's sales rising 53 percent over 2016 to 770,000 vehicles. Beijing is using sales quotas and fuel efficiency standards to press global automakers to help local suppliers develop battery technology. A deputy industry minister said in September that Beijing was developing a timetable to join France and Britain in ending sales of gasoline cars. BYD Auto is the biggest global electric car producer by number of units sold and has a factory in California that produces electric buses. BYD Auto manufactures under its own brand and also has a joint venture, Denza, with Daimler's Mercedes unit. ""Foreign brands will not have as much of an advantage as they had with combustion engines,"" said Zeng. ""More or less, Chinese brands already compete with them on a similar level in electric cars."" The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China welcomed the announcement and said it looked forward to details in a ""negative list"" promised by Xi. That would lay out which industries are off-limits to foreign investors, leaving the rest of the economy open to competition, instead of the current practice of requiring approval for every activity. ""The European Chamber hopes that this list will be concise to allow much greater participation of foreign enterprise across multiple industries in China,"" the group's secretary general, Adam Dunnett, said in a written statement. ___ AP Business Writers Paul Wiseman in Washington and Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report.",2731,2744,Auto Brand,190
98,"You've heard of Tesla Autopilot, but perhaps not always in a good way: The semi-autonomous driving system is now under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board for the role it may have played in a March fatal accident near Mountain View, California. But you might not have heard about Cadillac Super Cruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist, two other semi-autonomous driving systems that are available in new cars today. The Tesla, Cadillac and Nissan systems are not exactly the same. And despite a common perception of such technology, none of them allow the car to drive itself. But these systems can reduce driver fatigue on long trips or ease the tedium of slow-and-go freeway traffic. For new-car shoppers, it's important to know what these systems can — and can't — handle. HOW THEY WORK Semi-autonomous driving systems essentially combine two existing technologies — traffic-adaptive cruise control and a lane-keeping system — into a more cohesive whole. The cruise control automatically handles the acceleration and braking, while the lane-keeping system makes steering inputs that center the car within its lane. The adaptive cruise feature can be used by itself in these systems if the driver so desires. Whether or not the self-steering component of these systems is enabled, it's imperative that the driver remain vigilant and attentive at all times. TESLA AUTOPILOT Autopilot is the most well-known semi-autonomous system. It uses cameras and sensors on the front, sides and rear of the car to observe lane markings and to ""see"" other cars that are nearby. It's simple to engage, requiring only two quick taps of a stalk. There are no limitations on where Autopilot can be used. Drivers can enable it on the freeway, side streets, or anywhere with distinct lane markings. This freedom has a downside, though: Side streets are never as consistently well-marked as freeways, and the system cannot respond to traffic signals or stop signs. Autopilot allows for only about 30 seconds of hands-free driving before sounding a reminder to place your hands on the wheel. If you don't comply, Autopilot is disabled for the remainder of the drive. Notably, Tesla can update the Autopilot software over the air, not necessitating a trip to a service center. As a result, Tesla can quickly send out improvements to Autopilot's functionality or resolve problems with it, such as one Edmunds experienced during a February test drive in our Model 3. During the drive, Autopilot steered the car across the double yellow line into oncoming traffic, requiring the driver's intervention to bring it back into its lane. The problem did not reoccur after a software update. Tesla offers Autopilot on its Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles. CADILLAC SUPER CRUISE Cadillac's new Super Cruise system allows complete hands-free driving with no time or distance limit provided the driver meets certain criteria. Like Autopilot, Super Cruise employs a suite of external sensors and cameras. Then it adds a subsystem in the cabin that makes sure you're paying attention: an infrared camera mounted atop the steering column that tracks the driver's eye and head movement. If your focus is not on the road ahead and you make no attempt to take the wheel, the system sounds several warnings of increasing urgency until eventually canceling Super Cruise and slowing the car to a gentle halt. No other semi-autonomous driving system available today has such a sophisticated driver-monitoring system. Super Cruise is somewhat more cumbersome to activate compared to Autopilot and drivers can only use it on certain limited-access freeways that have been approved by engineers from General Motors, which owns Cadillac. GM updates the database of Super Cruise-compatible freeways regularly. For now, Super Cruise is available only on the Cadillac CT6 sedan. It's safe to assume it will be deployed on other GM vehicles, but the company hasn't announced any so far. NISSAN PROPILOT ASSIST Nissan's new ProPilot Assist system also is best on freeways with gentle turns and well-marked lanes on both sides. That's the environment Nissan recommends. While drivers can use the system on side streets, it's not well-suited to those roads. Some curves are too tight for the system to handle at the speed limit, and it will cancel its operation and readily return control to the driver in those situations. Like Autopilot, ProPilot Assist requires the driver's hands to be on the wheel at all times. On the whole, Nissan's system isn't quite at the level of capability of those by Tesla or Cadillac. Rather than referencing map data on board as the Tesla and Cadillac systems do, ProPilot Assist reacts to its environment in real time. For 2018, Nissan offers ProPilot Assist on its Rogue and Leaf vehicles, with more promised in the future. EDMUNDS SAYS:  While semi-autonomous systems do not make cars self-driving, they can reduce the stress of driving and are worthwhile features for new-car shoppers to consider. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

122,"DETROIT (AP) — At the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains sits a sprawling factory that has become an unlikely victim in the escalating trade fight between the U.S. and China. The plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina, is owned by German automaker BMW, and it exports more vehicles to China than any other auto factory in America. The 6 million-square-foot plant makes luxury sport utility vehicles, which are coveted by affluent Chinese buyers for their German prestige and reliability that's better than Chinese domestic brands. One in every four SUVs that comes off its assembly lines is shipped to China. Now those 87,000 vehicles could be subject to extra tariffs that could add tens of thousands of Chinese yuan to their already lofty prices. The trade dispute between the U.S. and China intensified last week, when the Trump administration released its list of imports from China worth $50 billion on which it would impose 25-percent tariffs as punishment for China's alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property. China retaliated with its own threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. products, including autos. In a move aimed at defusing the conflict, China President Xi Jinping on Tuesday indicated his country would make concessions, promising to cut auto import taxes and improve intellectual property protection but offering no specifics. China has promised similar changes in the past but has not followed through. If both sides make good on tariff threats, German luxury automakers, rather than American companies, will be hit the hardest. American and Japanese automakers produce most of what they sell in China at factories located there. In addition to BMW's South Carolina factory, a Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, ships as many as 75,000 pricey GLS and GLE SUVs to China. Because the German vehicles — with leather seats, heated steering wheels, sunroofs and other goodies — command high prices in China, the current 25 percent tariff on autos shipped in from the U.S. doesn't seem that outrageous. However, if the tariff doubles to 50 percent of the manufacturing cost as China has threatened, the German vehicles could be priced out of the market, forcing the companies to make them in China or elsewhere. A BMW X5 large SUV, for example, starts at $57,200 in the U.S. The cost to manufacture a high-priced SUV is roughly 30 percent below the sticker price. At 25 percent, the tariff would be about $10,000 (63,020 yuan) on an X5 entering China. It would double to $20,000 (126,040 yuan) if the tariff doubles. The U.S. isn't as restrictive about cars coming into the country. Currently, there is a 2.5 percent tariff on imported autos and 25 percent on imported pickup trucks. Trump is proposing to hit all auto imports with a 25 percent tariff. In addition, Trump last week threatened to add $100 billion more in tariffs if China retaliates against the U.S. It's not clear yet what products that would cover. Realizing what's at stake, BMW put out a statement supporting free trade and warning that a conflict could hurt its factory, which exported 70 percent of the 371,000 SUVs it made last year to 123 countries. One third of the exports went to China. ""Free trade has made the success story of BMW Group in the U.S. possible,"" wrote Kenn Sparks, the company's chief U.S. spokesman. ""In our opinion, a further escalation of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China would be harmful for all stakeholders."" The plant started off making cars when it opened more than 23 years ago at a time when the SUV was starting to catch on in the U.S. BMW quickly spotted the trend and began building one SUV there. It shifted the whole plant to sport utilities by 2008 as Americans and then much of the world began falling for the high seating and roomy cargo area. When it opened in 1994 with an initial investment of $600 million, the plant had 2,000 workers, helping South Carolina diversify its employment from textiles to manufacturing. It now makes X3, X4, X5 and X6 SUVs there, growing into an economic powerhouse as BMW hired a total of 10,000 people and invested $8 billion. The factory also supports 40 parts supply companies in the state. One study found that the plant spurred more than 30,000 jobs in the state. But Kristen Dziczek, a vice president at industry think tank Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says a trade war with China could force BMW, Mercedes and others to rethink where they make vehicles, and that could cost jobs in the heart of Trump country. Spartanburg County, where the BMW plant is located, voted 63 percent for Trump in 2016. BMW wouldn't comment on jobs. Before the tariffs were floated, it had plans to start producing the X3 compact SUV at a Chinese factory. Even so, Sparks says the Spartanburg plant will make more X3s than it does now because of high demand in the U.S. Other auto producers that could suffer because of the tariffs threatened by China include Tesla, which a Barclay's analyst said gets about 12 percent of its revenue by exporting about 14,300 electric cars and SUVs from California to China. Ford also ships more than 50,000 vehicles, mostly from the luxury Lincoln brand, to China. But most of what it sells in China is made there in joint venture factories. Ironically, the 25 percent tariff that the U.S. is contemplating against China could cost some U.S. automakers money. General Motors exports about 37,000 Buick Envision SUVs from China to the U.S. They would be subject to a higher tariff, adding thousands to the vehicle's $34,000 sticker price. Ford plans to export what could be thousands of its Focus compact cars from China to the U.S. starting in 2019. At present, the U.S. is besting China in the auto export business. Companies shipped about 250,000 vehicles from the U.S. to China last year, and China sent about 25,000 to the U.S.  But Dziczek says that is rapidly changing with more production headed to China.",5400,5413,Auto Brand,193
133,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai under an agreement signed Tuesday, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that suggested the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production.",793,806,Auto Brand,194

150,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German automaker Daimler AG said Thursday that its net profit fell 27 percent in the second quarter as the company confronted multiple challenges including trade tensions, weak pricing for its luxury cars, and recalls and product delays related to diesel emissions. Net profit fell to 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion), from 2.5 billion euros a year earlier. Revenues fell 1 percent to 40.8 billion euros. The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it saw weaker prices for its luxury cars amid global tariffs. It also cited a fire at a U.S. supplier that caused a production shortfall, as well as unfavorable exchange rates and expenses to fix cars recalled for diesel emission problems. The profit margin on sales at Mercedes, a key earnings metric, fell to 8.4 percent from 10.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter. The company meanwhile said it was experiencing slowdowns in certification of models under new EU emissions testing standards as it works on software and clarifies technical and legal questions. Daimler is facing investigations of its diesel emissions practices in Germany and the United States. It has voluntarily recalled diesel vehicles to adjust engine control software to reduce emissions on already sold vehicles. Diesel emissions came under scrutiny after Volkswagen was caught in 2015 using illegal software to turn emissions controls on when the vehicles were being tested and off in everyday driving. It emerged that other automakers' cars emitted more pollutants in everyday driving than during testing because the software turned down emissions controls to protect the engine under certain conditions. While that wasn't necessarily illegal, the testing procedures have been tightened to reflect real-world driving performance. Emissions-controlling software can be ruled illegal if it turns off emissions without good reason. Earnings at the truck division were flat while profits at its bus division and financial services business both fell. The company had already lowered its earnings outlook for the year, citing global trade tensions. China has announced it will raise tariffs on cars imported from the U.S. in response to tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Daimler makes vehicles in the U.S. and exports them to China so those sales would be hit by the tariff. The new Chinese tariffs took effect July 6, after the end of the second quarter. Other carmakers are also struggling with global trade tensions. General Motors this week said duties on steel and aluminum — a key material for cars — would raise its costs. CEO Dieter Zetsche said in a statement that ""the automotive industry, and therefore we too, have many challenges to overcome."" Zetsche said the company would strengthen its position with upcoming new models and technologies. He cited the company's investments in connected, autonomous and shared vehicle technologies.",2493,2506,Auto Brand,196

213,"DETROIT (AP) — In March of 2016, Keith Reynolds flew from California to Atlanta so he could claim his spot in line at 4 a.m., and get a three-hour head start on his West Coast competitors. Tesla was taking $1,000 deposits for its new electric car, the Model 3, priced starting at $35,000. And Reynolds had to have one. He managed to land near the top of the waiting list. Flash forward more than two years, through much-publicized production delays. Reynolds is still waiting. And now, like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide, he worries that the looming phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach. ""The tax credit was going to be huge,"" says Reynolds, 45, who works in digital advertising, lives in Laguna Hills, California, and drives a 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car. Last week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 — the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out. Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year. Then it drops to $3,750 for six months and $1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31, 2019. That means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $7,500 tax break — essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model's sticker price. Many Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out, predicted Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., an auto research and consulting firm. ""By then they will have been waiting for three years possibly,"" he said. Tesla wouldn't comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list. But if buyers bail, it could put the company's future in peril, costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history. Tesla is using the Model 3 to move from a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses. CEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year, but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company. In the first three months of this year it burned $1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont, California, factory. The company had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of March. In March, Moody's Investor Service sounded an alarm, downgrading Tesla's debt into junk territory and warning that it won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and drive profits. Musk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June. Like many of those still on the waiting list, Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $35,000 base. The cheapest version only comes in black, with other colors costing at least $1,000 more. At present, Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer-range battery packs. The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla's website, the lowest price was $49,000, beyond what he can afford. He wants the car badly enough that he'll spend over $40,000, as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $35,000. He'll hang on until the end of this year. Beyond that, he said he'll likely drop out if there's no federal credit and ""if no configuration options are made for the frugal, penny-pinchers like myself."" Others on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit. Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns. Most Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit — about 120,000 — are wealthier people who didn't need it to buy Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X, which can cost over $100,000, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid. He said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility. ""If you can afford to buy a $140,000 Tesla, you don't really need the incentive,"" he said. The only other automaker that's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors, which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April of 2016 because she believes in Musk's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero. Three months ago, she canceled her order, partly because of the delays, partly because she now wants a hatchback. Lindland also wondered if she'd ever get the car. ""I've already been on the list for two years,"" she said. ""I need all-wheel-drive, and I would have to wait another year."" She doesn't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week, and she is skeptical of the cars' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money, unable to service vehicles. Christian Kingery, a Seattle-area web developer, was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016. He wanted a loaded version with all-wheel-drive for rainy weather, but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits. He compromised and ordered a rear-drive version in April. But his delivery date was delayed, costing him the Washington credit, which he says was worth $3,000 before it expired in May. When all-wheel-drive became available, he switched his order, pushing delivery to September. Although Kingery is frustrated, he still wants the car.  ""Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing, in a way that no other carmaker is doing,"" he said. Like Reynolds and Lindland, he knows about the Model 3's impressive handling, 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen. He will just have to wait a little longer to drive one.",4397,4410,Auto Brand,203

244,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is making Miami-Dade County its new test bed for self-driving vehicles. The automaker and its partners — Domino's Pizza, ride-hailing company Lyft and delivery company Postmates — are starting pilot programs to see how consumers react to autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Self-driving startup and Ford partner Argo AI already has a fleet of cars in the area making the highly detailed maps that are necessary for self-driving. Ford also will establish its first-ever autonomous vehicle terminal in Miami, where it will learn how to service and deploy its test fleet. More services will likely be introduced as the partnership goes on, including Chariot, an app-based shuttle service owned by Ford. It's all part of Ford's effort to find viable business models for fully autonomous vehicles and get them on the road by 2021. ""This is, I think, the future of any automotive company or mobility company. If a majority of the world's population is going to be living in cities, we need to understand how to move those people around,"" said John Kwant, Ford's vice president of city solutions, who inked the deal with Miami-Dade. Ford isn't the first automaker to run test fleets of autonomous vehicles. General Motors Co. will start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City this year, while Nissan Motor Co. is launching an autonomous taxi service in Yokohama, Japan, next week. Technology companies like Waymo — a division of Google — are also testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in Phoenix, San Francisco and Singapore, among other cities. But the partnership with a specific metropolitan is less common. Both sides envision a deep relationship where Ford can help Miami-Dade solve specific issues, like how to most efficiently move people from its suburbs to its downtown monorail, and Miami-Dade can offer solutions like dedicated lanes for automated vehicles or infrastructure projects like advanced traffic lights that can send signals to connected cars. ""We want to be on the forefront of this because we want to give our people choices,"" said Carlos Gimenez, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, which is home to 34 cities and 2.7 million people. Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, says the company also intends to work closely with local businesses. The company wants to learn, for example, how a florist might use an autonomous delivery vehicle. ""Autonomous vehicle technology is interesting, but it's a whole lot more interesting with a viable business model,"" he said. The city of Miami is the fifth-most congested in the U.S., according to a recent traffic study by the consulting firm Inrix. After more than a century of selling people vehicles, Kwant says Ford now wants to figure out ways to move people more efficiently in order to cut down on that time in traffic. Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst with the consulting firm Navigant Research, says Ford and others must figure out how to make money on self-driving cars. ""If this does take off, if people do adopt automated vehicles and use them for ride-hailing, that's going to result in a decline in retail vehicle sales,"" Abuelsamid said. ""They need to figure out, if we're going to have a decline in the number of vehicles we sell to consumers, how do we keep our business stable?"" Kwant says the testing will also help Ford determine what its future self-driving vehicles need to look like and how they must perform. ""If you don't have steering wheels, how do you begin to use that package space? How do you begin to look different in terms of carrying more people?"" he said. Ford won't say how many vehicles it will have on the road in Miami-Dade, but says it will be Ford's largest test bed for autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. All of the vehicles will have backup safety drivers. Domino's experimental vehicles aren't even technically autonomous; they're equipped to be, but for now they have actual drivers. The windows are blacked out so customers can experience how to get pizza from the car without dealing with a person. Miami will give Ford new challenges. Previously, it tested Domino's cars in suburban Michigan, where parking wasn't an issue. But in busy Miami Beach, the cars will have to figure out where they can go to allow apartment-dwellers to safely retrieve their pizzas. An autonomous delivery vehicle from Postmates might have to switch between Spanish and English commands when it picks up a meal and delivers it to a customer. Self-driving Lyft vehicles will be tasked with mapping out the best places to wait for customers without causing more traffic headaches. Kwant says Ford will announce more city partnerships as this year progresses. But Miami-Dade was a natural, since it has good weather, lots of different urban and suburban terrain and support from Gimenez and other government leaders. Gimenez, who began talking to Ford in 2017 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, says he's not worried about consumer acceptance of self-driving cars. He thinks his community will embrace them as companies prove that shared autonomous vehicles can be cheaper and safer than regular ones. Gimenez says self-driving vehicles also can potentially improve traffic flow without significant new investments in roadways. They can travel more closely together, for example, because they're always watching the car in front of them and can brake automatically. ""That's why I'm really high on this technology,"" he said.",1235,1248,Auto Brand,206
245,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales shrank in December and ended 2017 up a lackluster 1.4 percent over a year earlier as the popularity of SUVs helped to offset falling demand for sedans, an industry group reported Friday. Last month's purchases of SUVs, sedans and minivans in the biggest market by number of vehicles sold shrank 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.6 million, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses edged up 0.1 percent to just over 3 million. Weak demand is a setback for global automakers looking to China to drive revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing the industry to pour resources into developing electric vehicles. 2017's annual growth was barely one-tenth the previous year's 15 percent rate, which was boosted by a temporary tax cut. Chinese demand has weakened as economic growth slowed and Beijing and other major cities tightened restrictions on car ownership to curb smog and congestion. SUV sales in December rose 8.4 percent over a year earlier to just under 1.2 million, accounting for 46 percent of the total. Sedan sales shrank 4.3 percent to 1.2 million. For the year, SUV sales raced ahead 13.3 percent to 10.2 million while sedan demand shrank 2.5 percent to 11.8 million. Global auto brands including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. and local brands including Geely and BYD have grown faster than the market, taking share from smaller Chinese rivals. 2017 sales by Chinese brands rose 3 percent to 10.8 million. Their market share expanded by 0.7 percentage points over 2016 to 43.9 percent. Sales of lower-cost, Chinese-brand SUVs, the most popular vehicle segment, surged 18 percent over 2016 to 6.2 million. The industry is the midst of a massive investment campaign to ramp up production of electric vehicles under pressure from Beijing to meet official minimum sales targets that take effect in 2020. VW announced in November it will spend $11.8 billion by 2025 to develop and manufacture all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for China. Ford Motor Co. announced plans last month to roll out at least 15 new electrics in China by 2025. GM previously announced plans to start production of a pure-electric vehicle in China and launch 10 electric or gasoline-electric hybrids by 2020. General Motors said 2017 sales of GM-brand vehicles by the company and its Chinese manufacturing partners rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier to just over 4 million. VW said December sales totaled 342,100. 2017 sales were up 5.9 percent at 3.2 million. Nissan said monthly sales rose 13.4 percent to 184,297. Annual sales advanced 12.2 percent to 1.5 million. Ford's December sales slid 9 percent to 140,103. For the year, sales were down 6 percent at just under 1.2 million vehicles. Toyota's sales gained 9.4 percent to 107,500. For the year, they were up 9.4 percent at 1.3 million. Geely, known abroad as owner of Sweden's Volvo Cars, said December sales by its own brand in China rose 42 percent over a year earlier to 153,625. 2017 sales were up 63 percent at just over 1.2 million. BMW AG said December sales of BMW and Mini brand cars rose 19.2 percent to 52,026. Full-year sales were up 15.1 percent to 594,388 vehicles. ___ China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (in Chinese): www.caam.org.cn",1308,1321,Auto Brand,207

272,"DETROIT (AP) — A fire that damaged a Michigan auto parts supply factory is causing production problems at Ford, Fiat Chrysler, BMW and General Motors, but it's too soon to tell yet whether dealers will run short of vehicles. So far Ford has been hit hardest by parts shortages. The company has had to temporarily lay off 7,600 workers as it cuts production of the F-Series pickup truck, the top-selling vehicle in America. But General Motors has been forced to stop producing full-size vans at a factory in Missouri, and production of Fiat Chrysler's Pacifica minivan has been curtailed in Windsor, Ontario. BMW says it expects some production interruptions at its SUV plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina. It's all because of a May 2 fire that severely damaged the main plant at the Meridian Magnesium Products of America factory in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, near Lansing that makes structural parts, about one-third of which goes to Ford. Multiple automakers have turned to Meridian to produce parts made of the lightweight metal as they try to shed pounds to meet government fuel efficiency standards. On Wednesday, Ford announced that it was suspending F-150 and Super Duty pickup production in Kansas City, Missouri; Dearborn, Michigan; and Louisville, Kentucky. The temporary layoffs took place in Kansas City and Dearborn, while workers in Louisville, Kentucky, who made the Super Duty will switch to large Lincoln and Ford SUVs that also are made at the plant. Ford says it's working with suppliers to limit the impact on production. ""We're confident that any impacts will be short-term,"" Joe Hinrichs, executive vice president and president of Global Operations, said in a statement. The company said it still has an ample selection of trucks at U.S. dealerships. At the current sales rate, Ford Motor Co. has enough trucks to last 84 days. The company said Wednesday that the parts shortage and production cuts will have a short-term impact on earnings, but Ford is sticking with full-year guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.70. While the auto industry has a history of working around parts shortages from natural disasters and fires, it may be more difficult this time because there are few companies that produce magnesium parts, said Kristen Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research's Industry, Labor & Economics Group. ""There's a lot of demand for these light-weighting materials,"" she said. ""Everybody needs it. Everybody wants it, and the supply chain isn't mature yet for this kind of volume."" Equipment that wasn't damaged will have to be relocated and automakers will have to find another place to get magnesium castings, Dziczek said. Meridian has other buildings in Eaton Rapids and another magnesium plant in Ontario, but it's unclear how much volume they can pick up, she said. A message was left Thursday for officials at Meridian. Fiat Chrysler confirmed that Pacifica production had been affected but said no workers had been laid off. Instead, they'll make more of an older minivan as the company works with Meridian to get more Pacifica parts. Spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said FCA isn't expecting any large production disruptions at any factories other than Windsor. But a union official at a Jeep Wrangler SUV plant in Toledo, Ohio, say it's possible some weekend overtime shifts could be cut due to parts shortages. Mark Epley, Jeep unit chairman for United Auto Workers Local 12, said Thursday they've got parts and still are running 10-hour shifts. ""This weekend may be a different story,"" he said. At GM's Wentzville, Missouri, factory, the company has been forced to cut production of the GMC Savana and Chevrolet Express big vans. But workers there have shifted to building midsize pickup trucks that come down the same assembly line, said spokesman Nick Richards. It's not clear how long van production will be suspended, he said. BMW said it's working to find other sources for magnesium parts but until supplies stabilize, it won't build as many X5 and X6 SUVs. X3 and X4 production won't be affected. Ford expects to continue Super Duty production at a factory in Avon Lake, Ohio, near Cleveland. The cause of the fire at the Meridian plant isn't known. Authorities said there were explosions and two workers were hurt. People reported feeling the blasts miles away. ___ John Seewer contributed to this report from Toledo, Ohio.",135,148,Auto Brand,211

282,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. reported higher fourth-quarter and full-year earnings Wednesday, but the mood was subdued as the company warned that it's facing a tough year. Sales in North America — responsible for 89 percent of Ford's pretax profits in 2017 — are slowing down after reaching record highs, so Ford will have to fight harder to hold onto its share of that market. Rising interest rates will impact profits at Ford's credit arm. Ford says it's facing big losses in its mobility unit, which plans to start testing self-driving vehicles in multiple cities this year. And the company continues to be hurt by rising costs for steel and aluminum, which accounted for a $1.2 billion hit to its 2017 earnings. Ford spends around $10 billion on commodities each year; steel and aluminum make up two-thirds of that total. Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said the company might be able to absorb those hits if it were leaner and nimbler. Ford ended 2017 with a 6 percent adjusted operating margin and expects that to fall this year, far from its goal of achieving an 8 percent margin. By contrast, its chief rival General Motors Co. reported a 7.5 percent adjusted operating margin in the third quarter. ""It's very, very clear that we have to improve the fitness of the company,"" Shanks told reporters Wednesday. Ford CEO Jim Hackett said the company has teams in place figuring out plans to pare billions in costs. It wants to cut vehicle engineering costs, for example, and simplify manufacturing by offering customers fewer ways to order popular vehicles like the Ford Escape SUV. Hackett also said the company believes it can chop marketing costs by targeting customers more effectively. Ford has said it wants to cut $14 billion in costs by 2022. But on a conference call, analysts expressed frustration with the scant details Hackett has provided so far. ""What's taking the time is we're going through and doing all the fact-based work to find out where the biggest opportunities are,"" Hackett said. ""The more time I've gotten with it, the more hopeful and clear it's becoming to me about where we can find the savings."" For 2017, Ford's full-year earnings jumped 65 percent to $7.6 billion. Shanks said the recent tax reform package gave Ford a $400 million boost in the calculation of its future tax obligations. The company expects its ongoing tax rate to fall from 30 percent to 18 percent in 2019. Ford's adjusted full-year earnings of $1.78 per share fell just short of Wall Street's predictions. Analysts polled by FactSet predicted earnings of $1.79 per share. The Dearborn-based automaker expects to earn between $1.45 and $1.70 per share this year. The lion's share of Ford's profits came from North America, which posted a pretax profit of $7.5 billion. Ford eked out small profits in Europe and Asia but lost money in South America and the Middle East and Africa. Ford Credit reported a $2.2 billion profit for the year. Based on its North American performance, the company said its 54,000 U.S. factory workers are eligible for $7,500 profit-sharing checks, which will be distributed in the spring. Ford's automotive revenue rose slightly to $145.7 billion even though its global sales were flat at 6.6 million cars and trucks. That was higher than the $144 billion analysts had forecast. Ford earned more on each vehicle thanks in part to a higher mix of expensive SUVs and pickup trucks. Ford debuted its most expensive truck ever, the Super Duty Limited, in the fall; it tops out at $94,000. Ford's fourth quarter earnings jumped to $2.4 billion — from an $800 million loss a year ago — largely due to a recalculation of its pension costs and its future taxes. Its adjusted profit, of 39 cents per share, fell short of analysts' forecast of 44 cents. Fourth quarter automotive revenue rose 7 percent to $38.5 billion, beating analysts' expectations.",1134,1147,Auto Brand,213

299,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Donald Trump instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives Friday. The president met with top auto executives to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs. A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months. Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards. The EPA under Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025. The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard. If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. Any big change by Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states. In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard. ""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina. As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily. Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens."" ""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable."" Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales. Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump. Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said. Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars. Auto executives attending the meeting included Marchionne, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett and Bob Carter, executive vice president of North America for Toyota. __ Krisher reported from Detroit. __ On Twitter follow Tom Krisher at http://twitter.com/TKrisher and Ken Thomas at http://twitter.com/KThomasDC",5612,5625,Auto Brand,216
317,"Most car shoppers know that a used car can be a fantastic value. In the long run, a used car will usually cost less than a new one, and it will virtually always be cheaper than leasing a car every three years. As practical as it is to buy a used car, it can also present an opportunity to get a little fancy. This is where ""cousin cars"" come in. Cousin cars are vehicles that are produced by one parent company and offered in two versions: one for the luxury buyers and the other for the masses. But because luxury vehicles tend to depreciate more quickly than everyday cars, the price difference often narrows as the cars age. The upshot is that if you shop for an upscale used cousin car, it is often possible to get it for a price that's close to that of its more mundane relation. Some cousin car pairings include the workaday and the luxurious , the fuel-efficient and the sporty , and the commodious and the fully appointed . Here are a few examples across different car segments. These are based on average transaction prices for the year, make and model discussed. They do not represent any particular trim level: SEDANS: and In 2012, the average transaction price for a new Lincoln MKZ was roughly $37,024. That's about $11,600 more than the average price of its mass-market cousin, the 2012 Ford Fusion, which had an average sale price of $25,427. The average sale price of a used 2012 MKZ is now $12,887 compared to $9,939 for a 2012 Fusion, narrowing the difference to about $2,900. If you opt to buy an MKZ for that extra $2,900, you'll get a plusher cabin, fancier styling, heated and cooled leather seats with memory function, and a long list of other standard features. and If you were considering both the ES 350 and the Camry as new cars six years ago, you would have had to decide if the Lexus, which had an average transaction price of $38,415, was worth paying $14,000 more than the well-equipped but less opulent Camry. The Camry's average sale price was $24,306 in the same time frame. If you shop for them as used cars now, you'll find the ES 350 will have an average sale price of $17,775, only about $5,500 more than the average used car price of a 2012 Camry, which is $12,285. The ES 350 has upgraded features such as smart-key access, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, larger wheels and tires, the option of parking assist, and a quieter, more refined ride quality. MIDSIZE SUV: and The 2013 Lexus GX is a midsize SUV that has all the features you'd expect in a high-end vehicle. But its standard V8 engine, off-road prowess and 6,500-pound towing capability set it apart from luxury crossovers that wouldn't dare to cross a stream. Its utility reflects its kinship to the Toyota 4Runner: They share a fair amount of automotive DNA. In 2013, the GX had an average transaction price of $57,181 compared to $36,704 for the 2013 4Runner, for a $20,477 difference. As used vehicles, the average price for a 2103 GX is about $29,509. A used 2013 4Runner will have an average sale price of $25,245. That difference is only about $4,300. If you pony up the extra money for the GX, you would get a well-appointed interior that includes heated and cooled leather seats, a moonroof and a power-folding third-row seat. The Lexus also has a more premium feel and an upscale exterior to match. LARGE SUV: and A new 2013 Escalade had an average price of $71,747. The average sale price of its cousin, the 2013 GMC Yukon, was $55,041, for a $16,706 difference. Fast-forward to 2018, and the price average price of a used 2013 Escalade is $35,871, compared to $31,346 for a 2013 Yukon, a difference of about $4,500. The extra charge for the Escalade gets you an engine that's larger and more powerful than the engines found in the Yukon line (with the exception of the Yukon Denali). You'll also get a flashier exterior, standard navigation, a Bose stereo system, and a slew of other luxury upgrades. When you're shopping cousin cars, remember that the luxury option could come with additional long-term costs, such as a higher insurance rate and more expensive parts and service. It might also require premium fuel, which can cost up to 50 cents more per gallon. To help you shop, here are the standard car brands and their luxury cousins: — Honda and Acura — Volkswagen and Audi — Ford and Lincoln — Hyundai and Genesis — Nissan and Infiniti — Toyota and Lexus When it comes to General Motors, the vehicle hierarchy isn't always quite as clear. The GM family includes Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. Several vehicles share platforms across the brand names with varying degrees of upgrades. As a rule, Chevrolet is the entry point. Buick and GMC are more upscale. Cadillac is strictly luxury. EDMUNDS SAYS: If you're a savvy shopper, you might be able to get a great deal on a used luxury vehicle for not much more than the price of its more humble cousin. Being practical doesn't mean you can't pamper yourself. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

A notice posted on the Food & Drug Administration website Friday says the eggs shipped to restaurants and grocery stores in nine states may be tainted with salmonella. The bacteria causes nausea, diarrhea and, in rare cases, death. Twenty-two illnesses have been reported. The eggs were distributed from a farm in eastern North Carolina's Hyde County by Indiana-based Rose Acre Farms.

Large retailers with brick-and-mortar stores have to collect sales taxes nationwide, but smaller online sellers can often avoid doing so. Large retailers say the rule puts them at a competitive disadvantage. States say they're losing out in billions of dollars in tax revenue. But small businesses that sell online say the complexity and expense of collecting taxes nationwide could drive them out of business. GM PLANT-SHIFT ELIMINATION GM ending shift at Ohio car plant amid sales slowdown LORDSTOWN, Ohio (AP) — General Motors says it will eliminate a production shift at its Chevy Cruze manufacturing plant in Ohio that could cost as many as 1,500 jobs. GM attributes the move announced Friday to falling sales of compact cars. The automaker says it will cut second shift operations at its Lordstown factory outside Cleveland by the end of June. GM officials say they won't know for several weeks how many jobs will be eliminated because of buyout offers and other factors. The automaker last year eliminated the plant's third shift and stopped production altogether for several weeks during summer because of shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS.

SAMSUNG-LOBBYING ALLEGATION Samsung denies Pyeongchang Olympic lobbying allegation SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung has denied a media report it launched illicit lobbying to help bring the 2018 Winter Olympics to Pyeongchang, South Korea. The Seoul-based SBS television network reported last week that Samsung tried to use as a lobbyist Papa Massata Diack, the son of Lamine Diack, a disgraced former head of the International Association of Athletics Federations. The SBS said the son requested Samsung to sign a $9.5 million sponsorship for the IAAF's Diamond League circuit from 2010-2012 in return for possibly lobbying some IOC members to support Pyeongchang's bid. The SBS based its speculation on email exchanges between Samsung and Papa Massata Diack that it says were contained among documents South Korean prosecutors confiscated in a raid on Samsung over a separate corruption investigation last year. Samsung has responded by calling the SBS report inaccurate. It says it's signed legitimate sponsorship contracts with many international sports organizations, including the IAAF.

463,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government's road safety agency is urging automakers to speed up replacement of potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement Friday that Heidi King, it's top official, has met with 19 affected companies urging them to accelerate the recalls and to post recall plans on their websites. The statement didn't say if automakers agreed to the request and NHTSA did not immediately answer messages left Friday. Automakers missed a Dec. 31 deadline to replace 100 percent of the oldest and most dangerous inflators, and they have been slow to complete the recalls, which began more than 15 years ago. Automakers say it's difficult to get people to take their cars in for repairs, especially with older models. Takata's inflators can explode with too much force and hurl shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 23 people have been killed and about 300 injured worldwide. The inflators have resulted in the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, covering 37 million vehicles and about 50 million inflators. ""It's imperative that manufacturers take every available step to reach each and every owner of a vehicle with deadly air bags and take action to ensure that those dangerous air bags are replaced as soon as is safely possible, King said in the statement. But Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said King has placed the burden on consumers rather than using the agency's authority to make automakers comply. ""Today, we see yet again this administration's inability to protect consumers as this announcement does nothing to make more readily available the replacement air bags that tens of millions of Americans are waiting on and deserve,"" he said Friday in an email. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said in an email that he asked King to demand that automakers submit binding plans to show how they'll fix the vehicles. ""She needs to stop begging them for action, and actually use her authority to get the job done,"" he said. Toyota said it already has made Takata recalls more prominent on its website and is publishing quarterly compliance reports that include scheduled recalls. NHTSA is managing the recalls in an effort to make sure the most dangerous inflators are replaced first. Nissan said it already has accelerated one recall because parts are available. A General Motors spokesman was looking into the matter. A Ford spokeswoman said the company has posted recall information on its website but didn't answer a question about accelerating the recalls.

(AP) — Dozens of environmentalists and others are speaking out against a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency that would roll back regulations governing the disposal of ash generated by coal-burning power plants.

The Trump administration says the new rules could save utilities $100 million annually in compliance costs and give states more flexibility in enforcement. Environmental groups, though, say coal ash can pose significant risks to a clean drinking water supply if it is disposed of improperly and leaches into the groundwater or spills into rivers. They say regulations imposed at the end of the Obama administration are just now taking practical effect and should be allowed to continue. YAHOO-DATA BREACH-FINE Ex-Yahoo paying $35M to settle SEC charges over 2014 hack WASHINGTON (AP) — The company formerly known as Yahoo is paying a $35 million fine to resolve federal regulators' charges that the online pioneer deceived investors by failing to disclose one of the biggest data breaches in internet history. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the action Tuesday against the company, which is now called Altaba after its email and other digital services were sold to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion last year. Yahoo, which is no longer publicly traded, neither admitted nor denied the allegations but did agree to refrain from further violations of securities laws. Personal data was stolen from hundreds of millions of Yahoo users in the December 2014 breach attributed to Russian hackers. The SEC alleged that, although Yahoo senior managers and attorneys were told about the breach, the company failed to fully investigate. The breach wasn't disclosed to the investing public until more than two years later, when Yahoo was working on closing Verizon's acquisition of its operating business in 2016.

In closing arguments Tuesday, defense attorneys attacked the prosecution's star witness as a serial liar who was fired and pleaded guilty for his own misdeeds at the bank — the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program. Prosecutors say the defendants concealed the truth about the bank's massive amount of past due commercial real estate loans before the century-old institution was hastily sold in 2011 as it bordered on collapse.

The pecan industry is also trying to crack the fast-growing snack-food industry. The Fort Worth, Texas-based American Pecan Council has been formed in the wake of a new federal marketing order that allows the industry to band together and assess fees for research and promotion. Critics call such orders government-backed cartels. But council members hope to elevate the pecan to the ranks of the almond and pistachio.",5750,5763,Auto Brand,229
495,"DETROIT (AP) — Automotive journalists crowned the Honda Accord the North American Car of the Year on Monday, a first for the longtime model that's twice flirted for the top honor as a finalist. The 10th-generation Accord edged out the Kia Stinger and Toyota Camry for the award, which was announced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The award program, now in its 24th year, has twice gone to the Honda Civic. Henio Arcangeli Jr., senior vice president for Honda's auto sales division, said the award represents ""not resting on past ... achievements."" The Accord, which went on sale last fall, is among many revamped car models hoping to snare buyers as sales fall and SUVs rise. Arcangeli calls the Accord ""new from the ground up,"" with more coupe-like styling and its first-ever turbocharged engines. Honda sold 322,655 Accords in the U.S. in 2017, a 6.5 percent decline over the previous year. The Volvo XC60 took the top prize in the utility category and the Lincoln Navigator for trucks. Other utility finalists were the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and Honda Odyssey, and Navigator beat the Chevrolet Colorado and Ford Expedition. Kumar Galhotra, head of the Lincoln brand, said the award should give the Navigator a boost as it tries to gain traction in the competitive full-size truck-based luxury SUV market. ""It is a very competitive segment, and in the past we have had much better share in this segment,"" he said. ""It was time to create a new Navigator and take that rightful place in the segment for Lincoln."" The brand sold only 10,523 Navigators last year, far behind competitors in the segment such as the Cadillac Escalade. The General Motors luxury brand sold 14,700 Escalades last year. Last year's winners were the Chevrolet Bolt, Honda Ridgeline and Chrysler Pacifica minivan. Sixty U.S. and Canadian automotive journalists serve as judges for the awards program, which patterned itself after the European Car of the Year. Eligible vehicles, chosen from dozens, must be new or substantially changed. The choices represent an aim to recognize the vehicles' overall quality: The judges evaluate finalists on value, innovation, design, performance, safety, technology and driver satisfaction. Organizers accept no advertising, though automakers try to capitalize on the marketing value of the awards. ___ Associated Press auto writer Tom Krisher contributed to this story. ___ Follow Jeff Karoub on Twitter at .

496,"DETROIT (AP) — The Trump administration is expected to announce that it will roll back automobile gas mileage and pollution standards that were a pillar in the Obama administration's plans to combat climate change. It's not clear whether the announcement will include a specific number, but current regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency require the fleet of new vehicles to get 36 miles per gallon in real-world driving by 2025. That's about 10 mpg over the existing standard. Environmental groups, who predict increased greenhouse gas emissions and more gasoline consumption if the standards are relaxed, say the announcement could come Tuesday at a Virginia car dealership. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said in an email Friday that the standards are still being reviewed. Any change is likely to set up a lengthy legal showdown with California, which currently has the power to set its own pollution and gas mileage standards and doesn't want them to change. About a dozen other states follow California's rules, and together they account for more than one-third of the vehicles sold in the US. Currently the federal and California standards are the same. Automakers have lobbied to revisit the requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. They say the standards will cost the industry billions of dollars and raise vehicle prices due to the cost of developing technology needed to raise mileage. When the standards were first proposed, the government predicted that two-thirds of new vehicles sold would be cars, with the rest trucks and SUVs, said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. Now the reverse is true, she said. Still, environmental groups say the standards save money at the pump, and the technology is available for the industry to comply. They also say burning more gasoline will put people's health at risk. ""The American public overwhelmingly supports strong vehicle standards because they cut the cost of driving, reduce air pollution, and combat climate change,"" said Luke Tonachel, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Clean Vehicles and Fuels Project. The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are involved in setting the standards, which would cover the years 2022 through 2025. Some conservative groups are pressing EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to revoke a waiver that allows California to set its own rules. They say California shouldn't be allowed to set policy for the rest of the nation.  Pruitt has publicly questioned the veracity of evidence complied by climate scientists, including those in his own agency, that global warming is overwhelmingly caused by man-made carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. If the waiver is revoked, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says the state will resist. ""What we're doing to protect California's environment isn't just good for our communities — it's good for the country,"" he said in a statement. ""We're not looking to pick a fight with the Trump administration, but when they threaten our values, we're ready."" Getting rid of the waiver or having two gas mileage and pollution requirements presents a huge dilemma for automakers: while they would like to avoid fines for failing to meet the standards, they also want the expense of building two versions of cars and trucks, one for the California-led states and another for the rest of the country. Mark Reuss, a General Motors' product development chief, said in a recent interview that he would rather have a single nationwide standard, even if it stays the same. He called two standards ""just waste,"" because they would require different vehicle equipment and costly additional engineering. ""I want one good one,"" he said. ""I could focus all my engineers on one."" Automakers agreed to the standards in 2012, but lobbied for and received a midterm review in 2018 to account for changes in market conditions. In the waning days of the Obama presidency, the EPA did the review and proclaimed that the standards have enough flexibility and the technology is available to meet them. Janet McCabe, who was acting assistant EPA administrator under Obama when the review was done, said Friday it will take a couple years for the EPA to propose new rules, gather public comment and finalize any changes. Any rollback would likely bring legal challenges, forcing Pruitt's EPA to defend the science behind the changes. ""This would all take a long time,"" said McCabe, now a senior fellow at the Environmental Law and Policy Center. In the meantime, automakers have to proceed with plans for new cars and trucks under the current gas mileage requirements because it takes years to develop vehicles.",3514,3527,Auto Brand,231

515,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales growth rebounded in January into positive territory, boosted by strong demand for SUVs, an industry group reported Friday. Sales of sedans, SUVs and minivans rose 10.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.4 million, recovering from December's 0.7 percent contraction, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses rose 13.6 percent to 2.7 million. Sales of SUVs, which make up nearly half of purchases, rose 22.9 percent over January 2017 to just over 1 million. The industry is coming off lackluster 1.4 percent growth last year as the market paid back a 2016 surge following a sales tax cut that boosted purchases by 15 percent. Weak demand is a setback for global automakers looking to China to drive revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing the industry to pour resources into developing electric vehicles. Automakers are forecasting this year's total market growth at 3 to 4 percent, a fraction of earlier double-digit rates. Demand has weakened as economic growth slowed and Beijing and other major cities tightened restrictions on car ownership to curb smog and congestion. Competition is intensifying as global and Chinese automakers pour billions of dollars into ramping up production of electric vehicles under pressure from Beijing to meet official minimum sales targets that take effect in 2020. January sales of electric and hybrid vehicles rose 430 percent, though from last year's low base, to 38,470. ""Despite being in a period of policy uncertainty, the trend of sales of new energy vehicles driven by the market still is relatively strong,"" said the CAAM general secretary, Cui Dongshu, in a statement. ""The development of new energy vehicles still faces many problems,"" said Cui. ""The energy density of batteries increases very slowly, which has led to low range that cannot satisfy customer demand."" Nissan Motor Co. announced plans this week to launch sales of its all-electric Leaf this year with a Chinese partner. It said they will develop 40 new models — half of them pure-electric or gasoline-electric hybrid — through 2020.

521,"DETROIT (AP) — It's the year of the pickup truck at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford unveil new trucks in a fast-growing and highly competitive U.S. auto market. But there are plenty of other vehicles at the show, which is one of the industry's largest. Mercedes and BMW have new SUVs, while several Japanese automakers are showing off prototypes of future vehicles. It's all happening in a U.S. auto market that's shrinking but still expected to remain at healthy levels. Last year sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million, still near record highs. Analysts expect sales to be just under 17 million in 2018. Here are some of the vehicles being unveiled at the show, which opens to the general public on Saturday: ACURA RDX PROTOTYPE Honda Motor Co.'s struggling Acura luxury brand hopes to revive sales with a new version of its best-selling RDX. Acura showed a prototype of the midsize SUV at the show, but it's close to the version that will go on sale in mid-2018. The 2019 RDX, which is the first to be designed in the U.S., is longer, lower and wider than the current model, with sharper lines outlined in chrome. A wide, panoramic glass roof will come standard. Under the hood is a new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Acura says the RDX will have the most legroom and cargo space in its class. There's also a touchpad to control infotainment functions on the 10.2-inch dashboard screen. Acura didn't reveal pricing, fuel economy or other details. VOLKSWAGEN JETTA Volkswagen's redesigned Jetta offers more room — and a shot at redemption as the automaker recovers from a 2015 emissions-cheating scandal. The German automaker says the 2019 Jetta is longer, wider and taller than previous models. VW also aims for a sportier look, with a large front grille, higher chrome quotient and LED lighting. The car has a new standard six-speed manual transmission. An eight-speed automatic transmission is optional on the base model. The Jetta's revamped interior includes a new storage console large enough to fit a standard iPad. The car is among the first of two new models planned this year and will come with a six-year, 72,000-mile warranty — double what it has been. It goes on sale in the second quarter at a starting price of $18,545 — less than its predecessor. FORD EDGE Ford Motor Co. is introducing a high-performance version of its midsize Edge SUV this summer: the Edge ST. It has a 2.7-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 engine that puts out 335 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. That's paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive comes standard, and there's a specially tuned sport suspension. The Edge ST also has special design cues, including a wide mesh grille, 21-inch wheels and ""performance blue"" paint. The regular Edge also gets an update, with a more efficient 2.0-liter four-cylinder that puts out 250 horsepower. New safety features include ""evasive steering assist,"" which uses cameras and radar to detect slower-moving vehicles. Pricing on the Edge and Edge ST hasn't yet been released. TOYOTA AVALON Toyota has taken the wraps off its revamped Avalon, which features a longer, lower and wider exterior and a rear cabin that extends another 7 inches (17.8 centimeters). The automaker boasts of a ""neater"" steering wheel, with a smaller switch cluster, enlarged hand grips and cruise control now accessible on the right spoke. The touch screen can be ""pinched"" or ""flicked"" like a smartphone. The new Avalon also can connect with a smart watch or Amazon Alexa-enabled device. The car has two new powertrains: a 3.5-liter V6 and 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid system. The Michigan-designed Avalon will arrive in showrooms in late spring. FORD MUSTANG BULLITT Ford Motor Co. is making a special edition Mustang to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ""Bullitt,"" whose unforgettable car chase scene helped turn the sports car into an icon. The 2019 Mustang Bullitt — due out this summer — will have an upgraded 5.0-liter V8 engine that puts out 475 horsepower. It has a top speed of 163 miles per hour (262 kilometers per hour) and a manual transmission with a white cue-ball shift knob. It's available in dark highland green, the color ""Bullitt"" made famous, as well as black. Molly McQueen — granddaughter of ""Bullitt"" star Steve McQueen — introduced the 2019 Mustang Bullitt on Sunday at the Detroit auto show. It's the first Ford has produced since 2008. Ford didn't reveal the cost. MERCEDES G-CLASS Mercedes' boxy-looking G-Class SUV gets a face-lift that the company says will boost performance both on and off the road. The company readily acknowledges that its appearance hasn't changed much in almost four decades. But the 2019 version gets numerous changes including 2 additional inches (5 additional centimeters) of length and 4.8 inches (12 centimeters) of width. The G-Class gets a new independent front suspension as well as a nine-speed automatic transmission. It's still powered by a 4-liter V8 with 416 horsepower. It also gets new LED headlamps. The G-Class will go on sale in the U.S. by late 2018, but no specific date was announced, nor pricing or fuel mileage. BMW X2 BMW's sporty X2 small SUV will sit between the compact X1 and the bigger X3 in the automaker's lineup. It sits low and has a more muscular body than its siblings. The X2 also has a widened version of BMW's signature double kidney grille. The 228-horsepower xDrive28i, which goes on sale in the U.S. in March, is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It's mated to an eight-speed transmission. The 192-horsepower sDrive28i goes on sale later this spring. Drivers can flip a switch and choose a driving mode, from comfort, eco-friendly or sport. The suspension can also be lowered for more dynamic driving. On the optional M Sport X Package, drivers get gearshift paddles on the steering wheel for quicker shifting.

544,"DETROIT (AP) — An investigation has found that the U.S. government's highway safety agency failed to act quickly on a consumer complaint, and that could have delayed recalls of dangerous Takata air bag inflators. A report by the Transportation Department's Inspector General also found that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration process for monitoring car and truck recalls isn't adequate. And the report released Wednesday says the agency isn't verifying recall completion rates reported by automakers or making sure manufacturers file proper documents. ""Overall, inadequate controls and processes for verifying and collecting manufacturer-reported information have hindered NHTSA's ability to oversee safety recall implementation,"" the inspector general wrote. The safety agency responded with a statement Wednesday saying that it had taken ""unprecedented actions to ensure public safety is prioritized,"" including improvements to search functions on its Takata recall website, and that it continues to improve its processes. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, the ranking Democrat on a committee that oversees NHTSA, said the report is cause for the Senate not to confirm Deputy Administrator Heidi King as NHTSA's leader. ""This is further evidence that the federal auto safety regulator isn't doing enough to protect the public,"" he said in a statement. The report is one of at least three in recent years criticizing the agency for its oversight of recalls. Investigations have discovered NHTSA shortcomings in the large recalls involving faulty General Motors small-car ignition switches and unintended acceleration involving Toyota vehicles. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office recommended that NHTSA develop plans to use data collected on recalls to analyze patterns and trends. That recommendation is still open, according to the inspector general's report. In the Takata case, the inspector general said that NHTSA managers did not make sure their staff sufficiently monitored repairs or the size of recalls before the agency and Takata reached a broad recall agreement in May of 2015. The agency did not act quickly on an August 2013 consumer complaint that indicated the Takata recalls didn't cover enough vehicles. The inaction ""may have delayed recalls of affected vehicles,"" the report said. Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high heat and humidity and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister designed to contain the explosion. That can hurl shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 23 people have been killed and about 300 injured worldwide because of the problem, which forced Takata into bankruptcy protection. The problem touched off the largest series of recalls in U.S. automotive history covering 37 million vehicles and more than 50 million vehicles. The inspector general found that NHTSA's ""minimal action"" to address low Takata recall completion rates ""may have contributed to the slow implementation of these recalls between 2008 and 2015."" The report recommendations include having NHTSA develop a process to monitor reporting of recall repairs, the size of recalls and the risk of the defects. It said the process should include taking ""appropriate steps"" with manufacturers that don't obey recall rules, ""including enforcement actions when necessary.""",1558,1571,Auto Brand,236
548,"DETROIT (AP) — The CEO of France-based automaker PSA Group says it will offer 40 electric models across its lineup by 2025, and it plans to sell vehicles in the U.S. within 10 years. Carlos Tavares told the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on Wednesday night that PSA already offers mobility services in the U.S. and soon will start car-sharing in some major cities.

570,"DETROIT (AP) — Two technology giants announced major new investments in self-driving vehicles Thursday, bringing the world a step closer to a time when autonomous cars are a part of everyday life — a reality that General Motors aims to achieve in some places as early as next year. The deals, and other ongoing negotiations, show that the technology is authentic and it's accelerating. ""It's all starting to coalesce into something that's more real,"" said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid, who closely follows autonomous vehicle developments. SoftBank, a giant Japanese tech investment firm, announced Thursday it would spend $2.25 billion for a 20 percent stake in GM's autonomous vehicle business. Then Waymo, Google's self-driving operation, said it would buy up to 62,000 more minivans from Fiat Chrysler to expand its soon-to-start ride-hailing venture. Not to be outdone, Uber's new CEO said at a Wednesday conference that he's in talks with Waymo about adding Waymo self-driving vehicles to the Uber network to carry passengers, although there was no indication that was imminent. ""Everything in the autonomous world is moving very quickly,"" said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book. Also, as part of the Waymo-Fiat Chrysler announcement, the companies said they are discussing use of Waymo technology in Fiat-Chrysler self-driving vehicles that would be sold to the public. That raises the possibility that personal car ownership won't die if robotaxis become ubiquitous. Waymo, the current front-runner, already is testing self-driving Chrysler vans with no human backup behind the wheel in Arizona. The company plans to start an app-based autonomous ride-hailing service there later this year. At GM, widely viewed as being in second place, the SoftBank cash infusion will help the autonomous unit named GM Cruise to roll out a robotaxi service in at least one major city starting next year, CEO Mary Barra said. The deal, the largest yet between a technology investment firm and an old-line automaker, boosted General Motors Co. shares to their biggest one-day gain since the automaker returned to the public markets in 2010 after a trip through bankruptcy protection. The stock closed Thursday up nearly 13 percent at 42.70. GM Cruise would remain a wholly owned subsidiary of GM with the automaker keeping roughly 80 percent of the business. SoftBank can trade its stake for shares in GM if Cruise isn't spun off into a new company within seven years. The stock soared because investors are starting to realize that GM is a serious player in automated mobility, Abuelsamid said. But analysts were cautious about predicting a future of self-driving cars everywhere. Lindland said the recent Arizona crash in which a self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed a pedestrian, as well as crashes involving Tesla Inc.'s semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" feature, have rattled public confidence in the technology. ""Even as the industry is pushing forward and collaborating and getting billions of dollars in investment, we can't leave the consumer behind,"" Lindland said. The announcements keep the front-runners on pace to start carrying passengers within the next couple of years in small-scale operations in a few metro areas, Abuelsamid said. But he said it still will take until the middle of the next decade before self-driving taxis are ubiquitous worldwide. Although he views Waymo as having the lead in the autonomous vehicle race, Abuelsamid said GM's alliance with SoftBank could boost the automaker's standing. SoftBank owns big stakes in Uber as well as in India's Ola ride service and Didi Chuxing, China's top ride-hailing firm. Michael Ronen, a managing partner for SoftBank, said Thursday the companies will make their own decisions, but Abuelsamid sees more alliances with GM coming. He foresees GM vehicles carrying passengers on the Uber, Didi or Ola networks. ""Softbank can become a conduit for GM into all these different companies that GM doesn't now have a relationship with,"" Abuelsamid said. Even though Waymo and GM now lead in autonomous vehicles, competitors such as auto electronics supplier Aptiv, well as ride-hailing service Lyft, chip maker Intel, and Ford, Renault Nissan and Germany's Diamler all have room to catch up in what could be a huge market, Abuelsamid said. Being able to produce the cars gives GM and other automakers a big advantage over tech firms that don't have their own auto factories, he said. Even with all the corporate deals, no one really knows for sure how people will get around in 10 or 15 years, Lindland said. They could embrace autonomous vehicles and the potential to eliminate the human errors that cause most crashes. Or they could distrust and reject them, Lindland said. Also, after the Uber crash, there have been calls for more supervision of autonomous vehicle testing. Currently the federal government and most states allow testing with little or no regulation. ""The last time our world was so disrupted could arguably be the internet,"" Lindland said.",213,226,Auto Brand,239

It was the fifth consecutive monthly gain with all major sectors showing modest increases. The Commerce Department said Thursday the December increase followed a 0.6 percent rise in November. It closed out a year in which construction spending rose 3.8 percent. It was the sixth straight annual increase but the weakest performance since a decline in 2011, a period when spending fell for five years as builders struggled to emerge from the housing bust and the Great Recession. For December, spending on housing projects rose 0.5 percent while nonresidential construction was up a stronger 1.1 percent. Spending on government projects rose 0.3 percent as strength at the federal level offset a drop in state and local construction. MORTGAGE RATES Long-term US mortgage rise for fourth straight week WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose for the fourth straight week. The rates on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages and five-year adjustable-rate mortgages hit the highest level since 2011. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac says the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.22 percent this week, highest since March and up from 4.15 percent a week earlier. They stood at 4.19 a year ago. The rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans, popular among homeowners who refinance, rose to 3.68 percent this week, highest since July 2011 and up from 3.62 percent last week and 3.41 percent a year ago. The five-year, adjustable rate rose to 3.53 percent from 3.52 percent last week and the highest since April 2011. PRODUCTIVITY US productivity falls at 0.1 percent rate in fourth quarter WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. productivity edged down at a 0.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. It was the weakest showing in nearly two years and further evidence of the struggles the country is having boosting worker efficiency. The Labor Department said Thursday that the fourth quarter decline followed a much stronger 2.7 percent gain in the third quarter. Labor costs increased at a 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after two quarters of declines. For the year, productivity rose 1.2 percent, a rebound from a decline of 0.1 percent in 2016, which had been the first annual decline in 34 years. But the rebound still left the average productivity gain over the last decade at 1.2 percent, less than half the 2.6 percent average annual increases seen from 2000 to 2006. TAX OVERHAUL-BIGGER PAYCHECKS Tax bill beginning to deliver bigger paychecks to workers UNDATED (AP) — The contentious tax overhaul is beginning to deliver a change that many will welcome: bigger paychecks. Workers are starting to see more take-home pay as employers implement the new withholding guidelines from the IRS, which dictate how much employers withhold from pay for federal taxes. Those whose checks have remained the same shouldn't fret — employers have until Feb. 15 to make the changes. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that the new rules will mean more take-home pay for about 90 percent of American workers. How much extra cash? It depends on several factors, such as workers' income, how often they are paid and the number of withholdings allowances they claim on their IRS Form W-4 with their employer. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a middle-income household would on average get a tax cut of $930 this year, lifting their after-tax income by about 1.6 percent. That increase won't be perfectly reflected in their paycheck, though. That's because lower tax withholding on paychecks is just a piece of a complicated set of changes to tax law that the GOP pushed through in December. And what your employer withholds is based on an estimate of your tax obligation that includes many complex factors, but it's not a perfect measure. TAX OVERHAUL-LOWE'S Lowe's to hand out bonuses, sweeten benefits amid tax cuts NEW YORK (AP) — Home improvement chain Lowe's says it's handing out bonuses of up to $1,000 for its more than 260,000 hourly employees, as it becomes the latest major employer to invest in its workers after Congress approved a tax cut that will help businesses. The chain, based in Mooresville, North Carolina, also will be sweetening benefits for maternity and parental leave as well as adoption assistance. The bonuses, which will be given out to both part-time and full-time hourly workers across all its U.S. facilities including distribution centers, will be paid in addition to Lowe's long-standing, store-level bonus program. Lowe's joins a list of other national companies likes Walmart Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Starbucks Corp., which are embracing measures like giving out bonuses, enhancing maternity benefits and raising wages. AUTO SALES Automakers report January sales DETROIT (AP) — Automakers are reporting their January sales figures. General Motors' sales rose 1 percent from a year ago. GM's Buick and Chevrolet brands both posted gains, but its GMC and Cadillac brands saw lower sales. GM's best-seller, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup, saw a 14.5 percent jump in demand. A new Silverado will hit the market later this year, so GM is heavily discounting the outgoing truck. Ford says its sales fell 6.6 percent, due in part to a decline in sales to rental car fleets. But its average sales price hit a record $37,000 per vehicle in January, largely due to a 1.6 percent sales increase in the F-Series pickup. Ford's car sales were down 23.3 percent. Even its SUV sales fell by 5.9 percent. Toyota posted a 16.8 percent increase. The company attributed the rise to strong demand for the RAV4, Highlander and 4Runner SUVs, which hit January sales records. Sales of the revamped Camry midsize car bucked the trend toward SUV sales by rising 21.3 percent. Nissan Group says its sales rose 10 percent to 123,538, a January record for the company that sells the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Sales were led by the Rogue small SUV, which was up nearly 26 percent. Fiat Chrysler sales were down 13 percent. Jeep brand sales rose 2 percent but other brands struggled. Chrysler fell 21 percent while Dodge was off 31 percent and Fiat sales dropped 43 percent. Even the Ram truck brand posted a 16 percent sales decline. Volkswagen sales were up 5.2 percent. The German automaker is recovering from sales losses due to its diesel emissions cheating scandal by introducing new SUVs. MITSUBISHI RECALL Mitsubishi recalls SUV and car models; belt can come loose DETROIT (AP) — Mitsubishi is recalling some of its top-selling models in the U.S. because the accessory drive belt can come loose and cause engines to stall. The recall covers just over 141,000 Outlander SUVs from 2008 through 2012, Outlander Sport SUVs from 2011 through 2012, Lancer cars from 2009 through 2012 and Lancer Sportbacks from 2010 through 2012. All have Mitsubishi's 4B11 or 4B12 engines. The automaker says a flange that automatically adjusts the belt tension can crack, causing the belt to detach. That will drain the battery and cause the engine to stall. It was unclear if there have been any crashes or injuries. Dealers will replace the belt tensioner with an improved one at no cost to owners. The recall is to begin March 27.

576,"DETROIT (AP) — For the third time in the past three years, General Motors has asked the U.S. government for permission to avoid recalls of potentially deadly Takata air bag inflators. The company disclosed its third petition to escape the recalls on Tuesday in a . The financial stakes are high. If the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lets GM out of the recalls, the company says it could save $1 billion and avoid recalling up to 6.8 million full-size pickup trucks and SUVs from the 2007 to 2011 model years. Takata inflators can explode with too much force and hurl shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 22 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The problem forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection and touched off the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history. Takata has agreed to recall up to 69 million inflators in the U.S. and 100 million worldwide. Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and inflate air bags. But high humidity and hot temperatures can cause the chemical to deteriorate and burn too fast, blowing apart metal canisters designed to contain the explosion. In its annual report posted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, GM said it filed recall paperwork and a petition to avoid the recalls with NHTSA on Jan. 9. In the filing, GM says the front-passenger inflators were custom-made for its trucks by Takata with bigger vents and stronger steel end caps than other inflators. No truck inflators have blown apart on roads or in extensive laboratory testing, the company says. GM disclosed that it hasn't set aside money for the recalls, and if required to do them, ""we estimate a reasonably possible impact to GM of approximately $1.0 billion,"" the filing says. The company is in discussions with regulators outside the U.S. and continues to gather evidence and share its findings, according to the filing. As part of a with NHTSA in May of 2016, Takata agreed to recall all of its inflators that use explosive ammonium nitrate as a propellant but don't have a moisture-absorbing chemical in them. The recalls are being phased in through 2020, with older vehicles in southern states getting top priority. Takata has filed recall paperwork for 2016, 2017 and this year declaring the inflators defective, including those made for GM trucks. GM filed petitions seeking to avoid the recalls in November of 2016 and , but NHTSA has yet to rule on them. Until it makes a decision, GM is not required to recall the trucks and SUVs. The agency gave GM until Aug. 31, 2017 to do research on the inflators. The company has said it will design replacement inflators so it's ready if NHTSA decides the recalls have to be done. NHTSA, the government's highway safety watchdog agency, said in a statement that it ""is reviewing all of the relevant data and information regarding the pending GM petitions and will issue a decision as soon as possible."" Curtis White, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, near Louisville, who owns a 2007 Chevrolet Suburban SUV, called GM's actions a ""corporate cover-up."" The inflator on White's SUV was recalled in 2016, but his dealer tells him nothing can be done to fix it.  ""They do everything they can to avoid doing anything to help people,"" the 71-year-old retiree said. Since the Suburban is his only vehicle, White says he has to let people ride in the front passenger seat. ""It's still scary,"" he said. He's also upset with NHTSA because it hasn't made a decision.  ""I don't think the government does anything with any sense of urgency at all,"" White said on Wednesday. Ford and Mazda also have petitioned NHTSA to escape from recalls involving about 3 million vehicles, mostly made by Ford, but no ruling has been made yet. As of Jan. 5, automakers had recalled 40.1 million inflators, according to NHTSA's website. Of those, only about 53 percent had been replaced, despite the risk of injury or death. Problems with the inflators date to 2001. The GM recalls cover two of its top-selling models, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. Also included are big SUVS such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade. GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson would not comment Wednesday, deferring to paperwork the company has filed with NHTSA. GM hired Orbital ATK, a Virginia rocket science firm that determined the cause of Takata's air bag explosions, to test its truck inflators. As of December, Orbital ATK had checked 648 GM inflators by simulating heat and humidity cycles, finding that they would perform as designed for 30 years, according to GM. The automaker said that in 4,907 more inflators tested in labs and in 63,000 air bag deployments on real roads, none of the truck and SUV inflators malfunctioned. GM also said its trucks have solar-absorbing glass that holds down cabin temperatures, keeping the inflators cooler and reducing hot-and-cold cycles that cause the ammonium nitrate to deteriorate.",59,72,Auto Brand,241

SUVs based on car underpinnings, sometimes called crossover vehicles, are what buyers want these days, and the Chevy brand didn't have a midsize one with two rows of seats to compete with the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano.

595,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Automakers, manufacturers and classic-car enthusiasts are coming out against President Donald Trump's plan to consider taxing imported cars, trucks and auto parts. General Motors warned in a filing Friday with the U.S. Commerce Department that the threat of auto tariffs ""risks undermining GM's competitiveness against foreign auto producers"" by driving up the cost of imported components and raises the risk that GM will face retaliation in other countries. The National Association of Manufacturers said in its filing that that the tariff plan would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States."" And Toyota Motor North America said the tariffs ""would have a negative impact on all manufacturers, increasing the cost of imported vehicles as well as domestically produced vehicles that rely on imported parts"" — such as the company's Kentucky-built Camry. Friday is the deadline for public comments on Trump's call for a Commerce investigation into whether auto imports pose enough of a threat to U.S. national security to justify tariffs. The president has cited national security concerns as the reason for slapping tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, drawing retaliatory tariffs from the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Turkey and India. Car collector Guy Mace of Springfield, Missouri, was one of many classic-car enthusiasts who wrote in to call for used cars and parts to be excluded from any tariff. ""Antique and classic cars (have) nothing to do with national security,"" Mace wrote. ""A wide ranging industry is involved the collection of antique and classic cars, and literally thousands of car enthusiasts, auction houses and repair/restoration shops derive their livelihood from this industry."" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the department had received 2,500 comments and expected more by Friday's deadline. ""The purpose of the comment period and of the public hearing scheduled for July 19th and 20th is to make sure that all stakeholders' views are heard, both pro and con,"" Ross said in statement.

The once bustling factory already has lost two of its three shifts and 3,000 union jobs since the beginning of last year.

602,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — General Motors said Monday that it has reached a tentative agreement with its South Korean labor union on measures to cut costs and allocate new car models to GM Korea factories. The agreement between GM and its union steers the American carmaker away from filing for bankruptcy protection for its loss-making Korean unit. It also paves the way for support from the Korea Development Bank, which holds a 17 percent stake in GM Korea. The union will vote on the deal later this week. ""Ratification of the tentative agreement is critical to our viability plan and securing support of the Korean government and our shareholders, KDB and GM,"" GM Korea CEO Kaher Kazem said in a statement. ""The labor union has demonstrated its commitment and we continue to work with our other key stakeholders to gain their support."" The agreement reached by GM and its union after 14 rounds of negotiations calls for freezing wages and canceling bonuses this year and cutting some benefits. GM will allocate production of new models of sport-utility vehicles to two local factories to stabilize their operations. Those models are ""important new products"" with big production volume that will be mostly shipped abroad, Barry Engle, GM's executive vice president told reporters. The GM Korea union did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The labor union shared part of the transcript from the final negotiations on its website where its union chief said that he will not forget how the company unilaterally pressured the workers to make concessions, warning that could be an obstacle in the company's path to recovery. GM shocked South Korea when it announced in February that it plans to close one of four Korean factories in Gunsan by May as part of a broader restructuring plan. Since the shutdown was announced, about 2,600 GM Korea workers, or 16 percent of its 16,000 South Korean workers, have agreed to leave the company in a voluntary severance program including 1,100 employed at Gunsan factory. One of the biggest sticking issues between GM and the union during their protracted negotiations was what to do with 680 Gunsan workers who did not want to leave the company. The two parties agreed to work toward resolving that issue by sending them to other plants and encouraging other workers to voluntarily leave GM. To keep its Korean unit afloat, GM is seeking investment and tax incentives from South Korea's government, which controls the Korea Development Bank. The government will decide on injecting fresh funds into GM Korea after reassessing its finances and outlook. The government said Monday that it respects the agreement between GM and the union. It said it would speed up due diligence under way to find ways to put GM Korea on track for recovery. GM struggled in South Korea as its cars lost popularity in the domestic market and its exports and profit margin fell. Since GM's acquisition of Daewoo Motor Co. in 2002, South Korea has served as an Asian manufacturing hub for GM, mainly producing small and compact cars. But GM's recent restructuring of its overseas businesses, especially its decisions to stop selling mainstream Chevrolet models in Europe, to sell its Opel and to stop selling cars in India, hurt its South Korean unit, which produced cars for the European markets and parts to be sent to emerging countries for assembly.",26,39,Auto Brand,246

621,"A Trump administration-led trade war with China and U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum are putting pressure on earnings for automakers, prompting General Motors to slash its outlook and, among other factors, cutting into Ford Motor Co.'s earnings. GM cited ""recent and significant increases in commodity costs"" for why it now expects 2018 profits of $5.14 a share, down from its previous forecast of $6 and below analysts' expectation of $6.42. Ford's shares slumped all day and fell more after it announced a 48 percent second-quarter profit decline to $1.1 billion. The company cited a number of factors, including a parts shortage that cut into its lucrative pickup truck sales. But Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks also blamed what he called an uncertain policy environment, causing higher commodity costs, mainly steel and aluminum. But the automakers may benefit from an easing of tensions between the United States and Europe after President Donald Trump and the leader of the European Commission pulled back Wednesday from the brink of a trade war over autos. In a meeting at the White House, the two sides agreed to hold off on new tariffs. That suggested that the Trump administration would suspend plans to start taxing European auto imports — a move that would have marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the allies. But the agreement was vague, the coming negotiations with Europe are sure to be contentious and the administration remains gripped in major disputes with China and other trading partners. Last month, German automaker Daimler AG lowered its 2018 earnings outlook, due in part to increased import tariffs for U.S. vehicles in China. The company said it now sees fewer SUV sales and higher costs at its Mercedes-Benz Cars division than previously expected as a result of the tariffs, and ""this effect cannot be fully compensated by the reallocation of vehicles to other markets."" Daimler produces vehicles in the U.S. In late May, Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum coming out of Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, which took effect in June, have driven up costs sharply as domestic producers raise prices. ""Our biggest exposure, our biggest unmitigated exposure is really steel and aluminum when you look at all of the commodities,"" said GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens on Wednesday. ""And frankly, the biggest driver of that is steel."" Trump's latest plan is to consider slapping tariffs on imported autos and auto parts — a move he says would aid American workers but that could inflate car prices, make U.S. manufacturers less competitive and draw retaliation from other nations. The Center for Automotive Research last week estimated that the potential import taxes of 20 percent to 25 percent on autos and auto parts would raise the price of an average car by $4,400. The duties would eliminate more than 714,000 U.S. jobs. The president has ordered the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate whether auto imports pose a threat to U.S. national security that would justify tariffs or other trade restrictions. Earlier this year, he used national security as a justification for taxing imported steel and aluminum. Last week, critics from the auto industry lined up at an all-day hearing with the Commerce Department to urge the administration to reject auto tariffs. They argued that the taxes would raise car prices, squeeze automakers by increasing the cost of imported components and invite retaliation from U.S. trading partners — and allies — like the European Union and Canada. Auto tariffs would escalate global trade tension dramatically: The U.S. last year imported $192 billion in vehicles and $143 billion in auto parts — figures that dwarf last year's $29 billion in steel and $23 billion in aluminum imports. Not to mention the $34 billion in Chinese goods the administration has so far hit with tariffs in yet another dispute over the predatory practices China deploys in a push to challenge U.S. high-tech dominance. Leaders in the auto industry have been raising concerns over the tariff impact for weeks. ""Imposing tariffs will increase costs for consumers, lessen consumer choice, lower consumer demand, reduce car and light truck production and sales, lower investment levels, and lead to job losses in the U.S. auto sector,"" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, in June. Other industries are also feeling the pain. Harley-Davidson says it expects new tariffs to increase the company's annual costs by as much as $100 million as long as the trade dispute between the U.S. and other countries goes on. Executives with the Milwaukee company spoke with investors Tuesday for the first time since announcing last month that production of motorcycles sold in Europe would move overseas in order to avoid retaliatory tariffs the EU is imposing on American exports. Harley-Davidson said it's working with the Trump administration and other governments to try to get the tariffs removed. In the short term, the cumulative impact will increase Harley-Davidson's costs as much as $55 million this year, the company said. Costs from raw materials subject to tariffs, like steel and aluminum, account for $15 million to $20 million, and the EU tariffs add another $30 million to $35 million, according to Harley-Davidson. ____ This story has been corrected to show the name of the person quoted from GM is Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens, not CEO Mary Barra. ____ Tom Krisher in Detroit, Damian J.

650,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric vehicle producer Tesla Inc. says it will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai. The step is logical for a company that looks to China as its No. 2 market. But Tesla faces growing competition from Chinese and foreign brands that are developing dozens of electric models. And its announcement said nothing about how it will pay for the venture. Here are five things to know about Tesla's China plans: ___ WHY NOW? The announcement comes amid an increasingly bitter U.S.-Chinese tariff battle. But the Palo Alto, California-based company has been talking with the Shanghai city government since last year about a possible factory. The timing appears to be driven by Beijing's April announcement that it would end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Other automakers including General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. have been reluctant to bring electric car technology into China to avoid having to share it with potential future competitors in such joint ventures. ___ WHY CHINA? China is the No. 1 electric vehicle market, with total 2017 sales of 468,000, or more than double the U.S. level of 200,000. Beijing is promoting the technology with subsidies and a requirement for every automaker to sell electrics starting next year or buy credits from rivals that do. China already is Tesla's No. 2 market after the United States. Producing cars in China would eliminate risks from tariffs and other import controls. It also would help to develop a network of parts suppliers to support service and make Tesla more appealing to mainstream buyers. ___ WHO PAYS FOR THIS? A make-or-break question for a startup in a capital-hungry industry. Tesla lost $710 million in its latest quarter, though it says it should turn profitable soon. The company's $5 billion Nevada battery factory was financed with help from a $1.6 billion investment by battery maker Panasonic Corp. Tesla has yet to give a price tag for the Shanghai factory, but the city government said it will be the biggest foreign investment there to date. Plans call for annual production capacity to eventually reach 500,000 cars. ___ WHAT ARE TESLA'S PROSPECTS IN CHINA? Tesla's estimated 2017 sales of under 15,000 vehicles gave it a market share of under 3 percent. That gives it plenty of room to grow in a Chinese market that still is expanding, while U.S. and European demand is flat. Also, Tesla will vastly exceed Beijing's requirement that electrics make up at least 10 percent of every brand's sales next year. That might mean it earns credits it can sell to automakers that fail to meet their quotas. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE COMPETITION? Fierce and growing. Local brands including BYD Auto already sell tens of thousands of hybrid and pure-electric sedans and SUVs annually. BAIC Group's EC line, starting at $22,000, sold 13,000 units in December, nearly matching Tesla's 2017 total. GM, Volkswagen AG and other global automakers are plowing billions of dollars into developing low-cost models with local partners. They are due to hit the market starting as early as this year, well before Tesla is up and running in Shanghai.",863,876,Auto Brand,249
660,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. sales of new cars and trucks tailed off in February as automakers eased up on discounts. Sales fell 2 percent from last February to 1.3 million, according to Autodata Corp. Among major automakers, only Toyota, Subaru and Volkswagen reported sales gains over last February. Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said automakers spent an average of $65 less per vehicle on incentives in February compared to the same month last year. That's a stark contrast from 2017, when incentive spending often climbed $300 or $400 per month. LaNeve said discounts could grow during the spring and summer, when tax returns arrive and more people shop for vehicles. But based on the first two months of this year, he expects automakers to remain fairly disciplined. In the past, heavy discounting has led to overproduction and steep declines in automakers' profits. Here are some details regarding February sales: — General Motors Co. sales fell just under 7 percent to 220,905. Sales were dragged down by the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, GM's top-selling vehicle. Silverado sales were off more than 16 percent from a year ago, when the company had record February sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. GMC and Chevrolet sales were down for the month but Buick and Cadillac sales rose. — Ford Motor Co. sales also fell 7 percent to 194,132. Ford said its car and SUV sales were down but sales of the F-Series pickup — its biggest seller — inched up 3.5 percent. Ford brand sales were down 6 percent while luxury Lincoln sales plummeted 23 percent. — Toyota Motor Corp. sales rose 4.5 percent to 182,195 vehicles. Sales of its top-seller, the Camry sedan, jumped 12 percent as an updated version went on sale. Luxury Lexus sales also rose 5 percent. — Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 1 percent to 165,903. Jeep brand sales jumped 12 percent and Alfa Romeo sales were also up, but Ram truck sales fell 14 percent because of a drop in fleet buyers. Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat sales also fell on low consumer demand for cars. — Nissan Motor Co. sales fell 4 percent to 129,930. Demand for Nissan cars fell 17 percent but truck and SUV sales were up 9 percent, led by the Rogue small SUV. Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand saw sales fall 7 percent. — Honda Motor Co. sales fell 5 percent to 115,557. Sales of its best-seller, the CR-V SUV, dropped 19 percent despite a recent redesign. Luxury Acura sales were up 1 percent. — Hyundai Motor Co. sales fell 13 percent to 46,095 as higher sales of SUVs failed to make up for declining car sales. Genesis luxury sales also slid 14 percent. — Subaru brand sales rose 4 percent to 47,209. Sales of its newly redesigned Crosstrek SUV jumped 61 percent. — Volkswagen brand sales rose 6 percent to 26,660.

US STEEL-CHEMICAL SPILL Chicago group sues US Steel over Indiana plant's discharges HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) — An environmental group is suing U.S. Steel, alleging that one of the company's northwestern Indiana plants has repeatedly violated its wastewater permit with illegal discharges. The federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Hammond by the Chicago Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation contends that discharge violations are ongoing at U.S. Steel's Portage plant and include an April 2017 spill of a potentially carcinogenic chemical. Nearly 300 pounds of hexavalent chromium entered a Lake Michigan tributary in that incident. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports the suit says that discharge was 584 times the chemical's daily maximum permitted limit. U.S. Steel says it regrets the incidents at the plant.

693,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Donald Trump has instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives. The president met with top auto executives Friday to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs. A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months. Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards. The EPA under Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025. The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard. If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. Any big change by Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states. In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard. ""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina. As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily. Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens."" ""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable."" Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales. Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump. Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said. Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars. Auto executives attending the meeting included Marchionne, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett and Bob Carter, executive vice president of North America for Toyota. __ Krisher reported from Detroit. __ On Twitter follow Tom Krisher at http://twitter.com/TKrisher and Ken Thomas at http://twitter.com/KThomasDC",5616,5629,Auto Brand,252

Scientists believe dozens of the invasive species that have reached the Great Lakes in recent decades arrived in ballast water. The bill would have allowed compliance with U.S. Coast Guard ballast water regulations as a standard for issuing state permits to oceangoing vessels engaged in Michigan port operations.

BUSINESS: TRADE-TRUMP-AUTO TARIFFS WASHINGTON — Automakers, manufacturers and classic-car enthusiasts are coming out against President Donald Trump's plan to consider taxing imported cars, trucks and auto parts. General Motors warned in a filing Friday with the U.S. Commerce Department that the threat of auto tariffs ""risks undermining GM's competitiveness against foreign auto producers"" by driving up the cost of imported components and raises the risk that GM will face retaliation in other countries. The National Association of Manufacturers said in its filing that that the tariff plan would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States."" And Toyota Motor North America said the tariffs ""would have a negative impact on all manufacturers, increasing the cost of imported vehicles as well as domestically produced vehicles that rely on imported parts"" — such as the company's Kentucky-built Camry.

VOLKSWAGEN-DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — A 60-year-old employee at Volkswagen's Chattanooga auto plant has filed a class-action lawsuit in which he contends the company is using a rebranding effort to discriminate against workers once they turn 50. The law firm that filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court said the named plaintiff is Jonathan Manlove of Ooltewah, who is a former supervisor at the Chattanooga plant. Attorney Kevin Sharp said the company is trying to change its image to a ""younger, sleeker company"" after an emissions scandal that has rocked VW since 2015.

766,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors has replaced the head of its Cadillac luxury brand, which has struggled for years to compete against German and Japanese luxury automakers in the U.S. The company says Steve Carlisle will replace Johan de Nysschen, who is leaving to pursue other opportunities. Carlisle had been managing director of GM's Canadian operations. De Nysschen was hired away from Nissan's Infiniti luxury brand with much promise and named president of Cadillac in August of 2014. A few months later he moved the brand's headquarters from Detroit to New York in an effort to give Cadillac more sophistication. But the move didn't help with buyers. Although sales grew globally, they fell during his tenure in the U.S., GM's most lucrative market. Sales declined 8 percent last year and dropped another 4.6 percent through March. Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst for the Edmunds.com car buying website, said de Nysschen bet heavily on the German luxury model of rolling out cars at a time when the market was shifting dramatically toward SUVs. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) In media interviews, de Nysschen talked about the shift coming, but Caldwell said the brand didn't move quickly enough to capitalize on it. Currently Cadillac has only two SUVs on sale, the full-size Escalade and the midsize XT5, with the compact XT4 coming in the fall. ""When you think about a market that's over half SUVs and you have two, it's not a good place to be,"" Caldwell said. ""That was a pretty big miss from a financial standpoint."" According to GM, Carlisle led a resurgence of GM brands in Canada, where last year it was the top-seller of vehicles to individual retail buyers. He'll report to GM President Dan Ammann, who said in a statement that the luxury car-buying world is changing rapidly. ""It is paramount that we capitalize immediately on the opportunities that arise from this rate of change,"" Ammann said. ""This move will further accelerate our efforts in that regard.""",15,28,Auto Brand,258
780,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Automakers Daimler and BMW have agreed to merge their transportation services businesses so they can expand offerings in ride-hailing apps, car-sharing, parking, and charging electric cars. The two companies said Wednesday they aim to become a ""leading provider"" of new ways to get around cities, where more people will see cars as a service they use when needed. Those businesses include car-sharing, an area where Stuttgart-based Daimler AG operates its car2go service and Munich-headquartered BMW AG has DriveNow. Customers use a smartphone app to find and unlock cars parked on city streets and use them for short periods when needed. Also part of the deal is Daimler's moovel startup, which allows users to book and pay for trains, cars, taxis and rental bikes. BMW's digital parking service enables ticketless, cashless on-street parking and helps uses find spaces in garages. The combined business would also offer charging services for battery-powered cars. So far, electric cars have only a small market share due to higher cost, limited range and lack of places to charge. Once electrics become as cheap or cheaper than conventional cars, their market share could expand quickly, and with it the demand for charging. The 50-50 joint venture requires approval from regulators. The companies did not say what its name, headquarters, or annual revenue would be, or what executives would run it. Auto companies are developing services businesses to fend off competition from industry outsiders such as Uber and Lyft. Volkswagen has set up services company Moia, aiming to develop and offer on-demand mobility; General Motors is operating its Maven car-sharing app. ""As pioneers in automotive engineering, we will not leave the task of shaping future urban mobility to others,"" Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said in a statement. ""There will be more people than ever before without a car who will still want to be extremely mobile. We want to combine our expertise and experience to develop a unique, sustainable ecosystem for urban mobility."" Daimler's Car2Go operates in more than two dozen cities and has more than 3 million registered users with access to 14,000 rental vehicles. At three locations — Stuttgart, Madrid and Amsterdam — the fleets are electric-only. BMW's DriveNow has a fleet of 6,000 cars in nine countries.

787,"Elon Musk's erratic behavior was front and center again this week as the CEO of Tesla conceded that he's overwhelmed by job stress, pushing his electric car company's stock down and bringing pressure on its board to take action. Musk's revelation, in a Thursday interview with The New York Times, came as government regulators are reportedly investigating whether his recent out-of-the-blue tweet about taking Tesla private violated disclosure requirements. Now, experts say Tesla has reached an intersection where the board must decide the direction of its leadership. Among their suggestions: Remove Musk as CEO, permanently or via a temporary leave of absence, or appoint a No. 2 executive who could act as a steadying hand. ""It's kind of bizarre,"" said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. ""It's a drama we shouldn't be watching."" Tesla presents plenty of challenges for the top executive: It routinely loses money and is burning through cash as it ramps up development of its Model 3 sedan, a less-expensive electric car it hopes appeals to the mass market. A large number of investors known as short-sellers have bet against the company. Musk has added to those pressures with lofty projections for profits and production that Tesla often fails live up to. Plus, the eccentric billionaire is the head of at least two other companies, including the rocket company Space X. Musk admitted to the Times that the past year has been the most ""difficult and painful"" of his career. The newspaper reported that during an hour-long telephone interview on Thursday, an emotional Musk acknowledged that he was working up to 120 hours a week and sometimes takes Ambien to get to sleep. Yet he said he has no plans to give up his dual role as Tesla's chairman and CEO. ""If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now,"" he told the paper. Tesla's board showed no sign of taking action on Friday. In a statement to The Associated Press, directors praised Musk's leadership, saying he had put hundreds of thousands of popular cars on the road, created tens of thousands of jobs and created significant returns for shareholders. Musk was not involved in crafting the statement. Shares of Tesla Inc. tumbled about 9 percent, closing Friday at $305.50, their lowest level since Aug. 1. For the week, the company shares lost 14 percent, or $8.5 billion in market value. Recent developments put board members in a difficult position because Musk, who entered Tesla as a major investor and built the company into a force that has changed the perception of electric cars, is the company's public identity. But Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business and law professor, said the board has a duty to shareholders. ""If the board does not get him out of this slot at a minimum on a leave of absence basis, I think the board is going to be seen by a lot of people who love the company as being derelict in their duties,"" Gordon said Friday. The board has stood behind Musk despite some bizarre behavior. For instance, in a recent tweet he labeled a diver who aided in the cave rescue of Thai soccer players as a pedophile. He later apologized. But a tweet Musk said he fired off on Aug. 7 while driving to the airport may force the board to act. In it, Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. Investors pushed Tesla's shares up 11 percent in a day, boosting its value by $6 billion. There are multiple reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the disclosure, including asking board members what they knew about Musk's plans. Experts say regulators likely are investigating if Musk was truthful in the tweet about having the financing set for the deal. Musk told the Times he stands by the tweet. At a normal company, Musk, 47, would have been replaced already, Elson said. But Tesla isn't quite normal. Elson said most of the company's directors have relationships with Musk, who owns about 20 percent of the company. ""At some point the board is going to have to assert its authority,"" Elson said. ""They're at a point where they're going to have to distance their oversight from any prior relations."" But even if Tesla's board wanted to remove Musk as CEO, it would be dangerous to do it abruptly given how much faith investors have in Musk, said David Whiston, equity strategist at Morningstar. Even with this week's losses, Tesla's market value is $52.12 billion, slightly higher than General Motors. ""Without the cult of personality around Elon, they're just a cult of personality that's burning a lot of cash."" It's clear from the interview that Musk is overworked, and Whiston said the best course may be to bring in another executive to help with day-to-day operations. The challenge would be finding someone good at the job yet willing to work at a company so dominated by one person, Whiston said. The Times cited people familiar with the situation as saying Tesla has been trying to find a No. 2 executive to help relieve some of the pressure on Musk. Tesla's board earlier this week formed a special committee to evaluate proposals to take the company private. Tesla later disclosed that Musk had talked with the Saudi Arabia government investment fund about a deal. ____ Krisher reported from Detroit. Choe reported from New York.",4594,4607,Auto Brand,261

SUVs based on car underpinnings, sometimes called crossover vehicles, are what buyers want these days, and the Chevy brand didn't have a midsize one with two rows of seats to compete with the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano. So GM on Thursday unveiled the sculpted Blazer in Atlanta. It'll have four-and six-cylinder engine choices with nine-speed transmissions. Mileage and price weren't released.

General Motors slashed its 2018 outlook, citing ""recent and significant increases in commodity costs.""

GM officials say they won't know for several weeks how many jobs will be eliminated because of buyout offers and other factors.

836,"DETROIT (AP) — Neither higher gas prices nor rising interest rates could put a damper on U.S. auto sales during the first half of the year. Sales rose 1.8 percent during the first half of the year, while June sales were up about 5 percent compared with a year ago, according to Edmunds.com. Analysts said the boost was fueled by strong consumer confidence and low unemployment. But analysts at Cox Automotive, which includes Kelley Blue Book, issued a cautionary note on the numbers, saying that much of the increase was due to low-profit sales to fleet buyers such as rental car companies, and retail sales to individual buyers were propped up by rising incentives such as rebates and subsidized leases. Sales are ""defying gravity"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox. ""Retail sales have been flat, and even those sales have been supported by incentives being up 6 percent."" Cox analysts also said rising interest rates and a possible trade war due to tariff threats from President Donald Trump could raise new-vehicle prices and payments and cut into auto sales in the second half. Still, given the fact that automakers are willing to spend to keep their share of the market, Cox analysts raised their full-year forecast by 100,000 vehicles to 16.8 million vehicles. Trucks and SUVs accounted for 68 percent of the market in June, a record high as car sales continued to fade, Edmunds said. The Federal Reserve in mid-June raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time and signaled that it may step up the pace of rate increases. The central bank raised its key short-term rate by a modest quarter-point to a still-low range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. It means that consumers and businesses will face higher loan rates over time. But Cox analysts said auto interest rates held steady in June, although they expect them to rise. Bankrate.com said on its website new-auto loans are now around 4.75 percent. Gas prices rose 63 cents per gallon over a year ago to an average price for regular of $2.86, according to AAA, taking a bigger bite out of household budgets. Here's how major automakers fared for the first six months of the year, according to Edmunds, which regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press: — General Motors, up 4.2 percent. — Ford, down 1.8 percent. — Toyota, up 3.0 percent. — Fiat Chrysler, up 4.5 percent. — Honda, down 0.5 percent — Nissan, down 4.8 percent. — Hyundai, down 3.3 percent — Volkswagen, up 7.2 percent",2298,2311,Auto Brand,267

CHINA-NORTH KOREA-TRADE China's December trade with North Korea falls 50 percent BEIJING (AP) — China reports its trade with North Korean shrank 50 percent in December from a year earlier as governments tightened sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development. The Chinese customs agency said Friday that imports from the North shrank 81.6 percent to $54 million while exports to the isolated, impoverished country contracted 23.4 percent to $260 million. The U.N. Security Council has steadily tightened prohibitions on buying the North's goods or supplying it with oil in an effort to discourage leader Kim Jong Un's government from pursuing nuclear and missile technology. CHINA-AUTO SALES China auto sales shrink in December, end year up 1.4 percent BEIJING (AP) — An industry group says China's auto sales shrank in December and ended 2017 up just 1.4 percent over the previous year as the popularity of SUVs helped to offset contraction in demand for sedans. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Friday said last month's sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans shrank by 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.6 million. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses edged up 0.1 percent to just over 3 million. Weakness in Chinese demand is a setback for global automakers that look to China to drive future revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing companies to pour resources into developing electric vehicles. CHINA-MARRIOTT-MAP TENSIONS China orders Marriott to suspend website, app in map furor BEIJING (AP) — Regulators have ordered the Marriott hotel chain to close its China-based website and app for one week after criticizing the company for referring to Tibet and self-ruled Taiwan as countries in a customer survey.

INDIA-ROCKET LAUNCH India launches rocket carrying dozens of satellites NEW DELHI (AP) — India launched a rocket carrying dozens of satellites from India and six other countries Friday from its island space center. A. S.

Apart from two Indian weather satellites, the rocket carried 28 micro and nano-satellites from Canada, Finland, France, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. The lift-off was postponed by a minute because of fear of collision with space debris, the New Delhi Television news channel said. The last launch of India's first privately built satellite failed in August because of a heat shield problem. Friday's launch is the latest in a string of successes for the Indian space agency. Last June, India launched its heaviest-ever rocket it hopes will eventually be able to carry astronauts into space, a feat only Russia, the United States and China have achieved.

CONSUMER-CONFIDENCE Consumer confidence rebounds in April WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers saw their confidence rebound in April to a level close to the 18-year high it had reached two months ago. The Conference Board says its consider confidence index rose to 128.7 in April, up from a March level of 127.0. The March level was just below the 130.0 hit in February, which had been the highest since November 2000. The business research group's index measures consumers' assessment of current conditions and their outlook for the next six months. Economists believe the strength in confidence reflects a strong labor market, with unemployment at a 17-year low, as well as the impact of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts approved in December, which began showing up in workers' paychecks earlier this year. NEW-HOME-SALES US sales of new homes shot up 4 percent in March WASHINGTON (AP) — Sales of new U.S. homes jumped 4 percent in March, propelled by a surge of buying in the West.

The two prior months had their sales revised upward with the annual rate being 667,000 in February and 644,000 in January. For the first three months of the year, sales are running 10.3 percent higher than a year ago. The March increase was driven almost entirely by a 28.3 percent leap in sales in the West. New-home purchases rose slightly in the South, fell in the Midwest and plunged in the Northeast. The median sales price of a new home rose 4.8 percent from a year ago to $337,200.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index released Tuesday jumped 6.3 percent in February from a year earlier, matching December's increase, which was the largest in nearly three years. Steady job gains and an increase in millennials moving out on their own has ramped up competition for homes. February's price gain far outpaces average increases in wages or inflation. Many Americans are reluctant to sell their homes as mortgage rates rise, preferring to renovate instead. Others are holding onto their homes because there fewer properties available. That's kept supply tight: The number of homes for sale fell 7.2 percent in March from a year earlier to just 1.67 million. CONGRESS-BANKING Senator warns bankers that Dodd-Frank relief could stall WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is warning bankers that legislation rolling back financial rules put in place after the 2008 economic crisis could stall. Warner says legislation revamping the law known as Dodd-Frank ""will not pass if it comes back to the Senate"" for another vote. Warner's comments are a warning shot to House Republicans. They want to amend Senate-passed legislation that would provide regulatory relief for banks. But Warner tells members of the American Bankers Association that 17 Democrats who voted for the Senate bill have taken ""an awful lot of heat."" They're not anxious to revisit the debate. The bankers are in Washington for a conference. Warner tells them the Senate bill contains several House provisions and ""we've stretched this about as far as we can go."" AUDI RECALL Audi recalls 390,000 vehicles; coolant pumps can overheat DETROIT (AP) — Audi is recalling about 391,000 cars and SUVs in the U.S. and Canada because the electric coolant pumps can overeat and possibly cause a fire. The recall covers the 2013 to 2016 A4, the 2013 to 2017 A5, the 2012 to 2015 A6, and the Q5 SUV from 2013 to 2017. All have 2-Liter turbocharged engines. The Volkswagen luxury brand says in government documents that the pumps can become blocked with cooling system debris, or moisture in the pump can cause an electrical short. No reports of fires are listed. Dealers will replace the pumps at no cost to owners. Audi says redesigned parts won't be ready until November, but dealers will install a new version of the current pump until the redesigned ones are available. IRELAND-APPLE Ireland to collect billions from Apple in back taxes LONDON (AP) — Ireland says it will begin collecting more than $15 billion of back taxes from Apple, 19 months after the European Commission ruled that a tax deal with the tech giant amounted to illegal state aid. The Commission ordered Ireland to collect back taxes for the years 2003-2014. Ireland disagreed, saying the ruling undermined the integrity of the country's tax system. But Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe says he will on Tuesday sign an agreement setting up the escrow account that will hold the payments while Apple and Ireland appeal. The payments should be completed by September. Donohoe says the government ""fundamentally disagrees with the ruling,"" but ""Ireland is intent on complying with our binding legal obligations in this regard.""

E-CIGARETTE-CRACKDOWN US agency cracks down on Juul e-cigarette popular in schools WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health officials are cracking down on underage use of a popular e-cigarette brand following months of complaints from parents, politicians and school administrators. The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has issued warnings to 40 retail and online stores as part of a nationwide operation against illegal sales of Juul (JOO'-uhl) to children. Like other e-cigarettes, Juul is an electronic device that vaporizes liquid nicotine into an inhalable vapor. Thanks in part to its resemblance to a small computer flash drive, Juul has become popular with some teenagers as a discreet way to vape at school and in public. As part of the FDA initiative, regulators are asking Juul Labs to turn over documents about the design and marketing of its devices. The San Francisco-based company says it monitors retailers to ensure they are following the law.",5846,5859,Auto Brand,270

Germany's transport ministry confirmed a report by weekly Bild am Sonntag late Friday that authorities have asked the company to answer questions about the way the emissions cleaning system in three of its models works. Bild am Sonntag reported investigators have found evidence that the cars switch off their emissions cleaning system while driving, for no apparent reason. Opel's rival Volkswagen was found three years ago to have used a so-called defeat device to ensure its diesel cars reduce emissions in official tests, but not during regular driving.

952,DETROIT (AP) — The Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank will spend $2.25 billion for a nearly a 20 percent stake in General Motors' autonomous vehicle unit. GM said Thursday that it will also sink another $1.1 billion into its GM Cruise automated division. The capital infusion is designed to speed large-scale deployment of self-driving robotaxis next year. The move widens the SoftBank Vision Fund's influence in ride-hailing services. The fund closed a deal in January to spend about $9 billion for a 15 percent stake in Uber. GM Cruise would remain a wholly owned subsidiary of GM with the automaker holding roughly 80 percent of the business.

956,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors says it will stop reporting its sales figures every month and instead will post the numbers each quarter. The move could prompt other automakers to make the same change. Currently nearly all U.S. automakers report sales monthly. GM says 30 days isn't long enough to separate real trends from short-term fluctuations caused by weather, new product launches or other factors. The company's sales are down 3.2 percent so far this year when the rest of the market is down just under 1 percent. Its sales fell 1.4 percent last year. The company has been reducing low-profit sales to rental car companies. Many automakers use those sales to boost monthly numbers.

GM spokeswoman Kim Carpenter says the company is still working on a staffing plan for the third shift, which begins in September. The Spring Hill plant now employs about 2,600 hourly workers on two shifts. They make the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5. Earlier this month GM said it will eliminate a shift at its Chevy Cruze plant near Cleveland that could cost up to 1,500 jobs. The move is due to slowing compact car sales.",15,28,Auto Brand,272
980,"BEIJING (AP) — The biggest global auto show of the year showcases China's ambitions to become a leader in electric cars and the industry's multibillion-dollar scramble to roll out models that appeal to price-conscious but demanding Chinese drivers. Auto China 2018, which opens this week, follows Beijing's decision to allow full foreign ownership of Chinese automakers in a move to make the industry more flexible as it promotes electrics. The ruling Communist Party has transformed China into the biggest market for electrics with billions of dollars in subsidies to producers and buyers. Now, Beijing is winding down that support and shifting the financial burden to automakers with sales quotas that push them to develop models Chinese drivers want to buy. That is reflected in the auto show lineup: Global and Chinese brands including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. plan to display dozens of electrics and hybrids, from luxurious SUVs to compacts priced as low as 152,000 yuan ($24,000). Communist leaders see electric cars as both a way to clean up smog-choked cities and a key ingredient in plans to transform China into a global competitor in an array of technology fields from robotics to solar power to biotech. ""Just in the last two or three years, China rose from being a very small player in the global EV market to be nearly 50 percent of sales in 2017,"" said Christopher Robinson, who follows the industry for Lux Research. ""It attracted nearly every automaker in the world,"" said Robinson. Starting in 2019, automakers will be required to earn credits by selling electrics or else buy them from competitors. More stringent fuel efficiency standards will require a big share of each brand's sales to be non-gasoline models. Global automakers say electrics should account for 35 to over 50 percent of their China sales by 2025. ""There is huge potential for vehicle electrification here,"" said Roland Krueger, chairman of Infiniti Motor Co., Nissan's luxury brand. Chinese sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 154 percent in the first quarter over a year earlier to 143,000 units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That compares with sales of just under 200,000 for all of last year in the United States, the No. 2 market. GM plans to display five all-electric vehicles including a concept Buick SUV it says can travel 600 kilometers (375 miles) on one charge, plus a hybrid Cadillac XT5 28E. The Detroit automaker, which vies with VW for the status of China's biggest brand, is launching 10 electrics or hybrids in China from in 2016 to 2020. VW is due to launch 15 electrics and hybrids in the next two to three years as part of a 10 billion euro ($12 billion) development plan announced in November. Nissan is unveiling an electric model at the auto show designed for China and will display an updated version of its Leaf and an electric concept car. The Japanese automaker also plans to develop a lower-priced electric with a local partner, state-owned Dongfeng Motor Co. Two more versions of that are to be sold under their jointly owned Venucia brand. China's BYD Auto, the biggest global maker of electrics by volume with 2017 sales of 113,669 units, plans to unveil two new hybrid SUVs and an electric concept car. The company also plans to display nine other hybrid and plug-in electric models. Infiniti plans to display a concept sedan, the Q Inspiration, that Krueger said will be the basis for future electric models. The sleek Q Inspiration has no air-drawing engine, and thus no front grill — a change Krueger said was suggested by Chinese designers at Infiniti's Beijing studio. The car has the roomier back seat that has become standard among luxury brands that want to appeal to Chinese customers who have a driver and ride in back. ""The first car is going to cater specifically to the needs of the Chinese market,"" said Krueger. Ford Motor Co. has announced a ""product onslaught"" this month for China that includes at least 15 electrified vehicles and 35 other models through 2025. Ford's first plug-in hybrid in China, the Mondeo Energi, went on sale last month. Washington and other trading partners have been irked by the Chinese controls that required global automakers to work through state-owned local partners and imposed other restrictions. Automakers complained joint ventures were cumbersome and expensive but complied because they gained access to a market that passed the United States in 2009 as the world's biggest. Last year's sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans totaled 24.7 million units, compared with 17.2 million for the United States. The Cabinet's planning agency announced last week Beijing will loosen those controls by allowing full foreign ownership in the industry, starting with electric vehicle producers this year. Limits for commercial vehicles would end in 2020 and for all passenger vehicles in 2022. That would end a 50 percent cap on foreign ownership of an auto venture, a limit that required automakers to share technology with potential competitors, adding to President Donald Trump's trade complaints against Beijing. ""Now you're going to see the difference between the partners that you want and partners imposed on you,"" said Carlos Ghosn, chairman of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Ghosn said his companies were happy with their Chinese partners. But he said with electrics, autonomous driving and other innovations give companies a new chance to consider a partnership or work independently. ""Every time there is a new opportunity we're going to consider, should we go with a partner? What are the advantages? Or should we go by ourself?"" said Ghosn. ""This is a new freedom for carmakers, which is welcome."" Still, while electrics may be China's future, most brands lose money making them. Profits come from sales of SUVs that are wildly popular with Chinese drivers who see them as the safest option on the country's rough, chaotic roads. First-quarter SUVs sales rose 11.3 percent over a year earlier to 2.6 million, or almost 45 percent of all auto sales, according to CAAM. Electrics accounted for just over 2 percent. ___ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",840,853,Auto Brand,273

1043,"DETROIT (AP) — It's virtually impossible to buy a car these days that comes with a set of shot glasses. The 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham, though, included not just a set of shot glasses but Arpege perfume, Fleetwood cigarettes and a powder compact in the purchase price of $13,074 — about three times the cost of a regular Cadillac and pricier than a new home in an upscale area at the time. Only 400 were built. Today the vanity kit alone is worth as much as the car. This is but one specimen of perfection at a nondescript location in Sterling Heights. A temperature-controlled showroom displays 165 vintage cars at a time of 700 owned. Each visit to the rotating exhibit offers a glimpse of something different. Designs range from 1902 to present, concept cars and road tested. Many vehicles have been purchased, reclaimed and restored after collectors died. A purple 1967 Pontiac GTO hidden under the sand of the Arizona desert was dug up, cleaned and refurbished. The General Motors Heritage Center protects one of the greatest vintage car collections in the world, curated and maintained by the Detroit-based automaker. It is also home to GM's historical literature and artifacts. For car collectors, the site is a jewelry box filled with precious gems. These include the most celebrated cars of our time, and those featured in Beach Boys songs and driven by Elvis Presley on screen. The unpublicized collection is somehow attracting visitors recently from Sweden, Australia, Poland, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, the reported. They're driving to the building just off Mound Road, between 15 Mile and 16 Mile roads. The dreary route is riddled with potholes. There's no big sign directing anyone to anything in particular. The setting is an industrial park. Viewing is by appointment only. Callers schedule visits months and years in advance. While access at the locked front door doesn't require a secret handshake, it probably should. ""Holy smokes. I've never seen anything like this,"" said Robert Wall, 89, a Detroit native who has attended every Motor City auto show since 1937. ""I had no idea this existed. I couldn't have imagined this in my wildest dreams. I could stay forever."" He was rationed to 90 minutes. To those who know nothing about cars or think they care little, well, there are simply no words. This is a design mecca. Everything is labeled with historical explanation and auto industry impact. Over there is a 1951 LeSabre and a 1931 Cadillac V-16 and Corvettes from 1953 to 2005 and the very first Oldmobile Toronado ever made. Plus, the Firebird I, II and III gas turbine concept cars from the 1950s. All this chatter about electric vehicles and innovation? Check out the enormous battery under the hood of the 1966 Electrovair II Experimental car. GM may be considered a front-runner on electrification today, but it's clear the institutional knowledge spans decades, said Greg Wallace, who has helped develop the collection over the past two decades as manager. (On this day, he was filming segments for the History Channel.) ""The collection tells a story of the history of the automobile and our fascination with car culture,"" said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty, the world's leading classic car insurer based in Traverse City. ""You're actually able to study the thinking and innovation of the company and see how things were applied or not applied to production vehicles."" Oh, and those Smart micro cars that tuck neatly into puny parking spaces in New York and San Francisco? Don't miss their predecessor, a 1969 512 Electric Experimental. Visitors learn that the word ""cranky"" comes from drivers in the early 1900s having a bad day crank-starting the car. The crankshaft would kick back and break a thumb or a wrist and, on occasion, come out of the crank hold and hit the operator in the head, Wallace said. Vehicles from the 1900s have headlight covers that open to reveal a lantern wick inside. Steering wheels in 1912 were on the right, not left. (Ford put so many steering wheels on the left side that eventually everyone else did too, Wallace pointed out.) Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, said classic car junkies can't help but savor trips to the Heritage collection. ""All of the significant show cars are there — the Y-Job, the Le Sabre, the Firebirds — as well as the company's iconic production cars — the Tri-Five Chevys, the 1959 Cadillac, the split-window 1963 Corvette, the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am Special Edition,"" he said. ""But there's also a strong collection of technologically significant cars — not as flashy but equally important."" Cars like the 1912 Cadillac, the first auto with an electric starter; the 1915 Cadillac, with the first mass-produced V8 engine; and the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, the first front-wheel drive American car since the 1930s. The first electric starter meant people of smaller stature, who lacked upper body strength, could start cars for the first time on their own. And the V8 engine created a new industry standard for more powerful vehicles. ""I admire GM for saving examples of less-than-stellar products, too,"" Anderson said. ""One of my favorite vehicles at the GM Heritage Center is a 1976 Chevrolet Chevette — no one's idea of a collector car today, but one that sold in the millions in its time. Cars like the Corvette made GM's image, but cars like the Chevette made its bottom line."" In the beginning, the goal was just to try and preserve history, Wallace said. ""I had no idea it would turn into what it has,"" he explained. ""Once history is gone, it's gone. I wanted to make sure we could tell our story down the road."" Now visitors can track a nation's highs and lows, changes and progress. ""You can see prosperity and optimism through the '40s, then where the industry was in hiatus from '42 to '47 for the war and then it all starts back up again. Wealth and prosperity was growing,"" said Mike Simcoe, vice president of global design for GM. ""You see the industry wrestling with the change of fuel economy targets in the late '70s, with more stringent safety requirements, crash requirements, and the way some of those regulations were applied and how it impacted the structure of the vehicles. The '80s were an odd period, in fashion and style generally. I can say this in confidence, I have photos of myself.""

1048,"NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices and energy companies rallied Friday after OPEC said it will produce more oil, but not as much as investors feared. While trade tensions remained in the headlines, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher at the end of a bumpy week. U.S. crude futures jumped 4.6 percent after OPEC nations agreed to produce about 1 million additional barrels of oil per day. Reports have said for weeks that production was likely to rise, but analysts said investors appear to think the boost will be smaller than OPEC says it will. So oil prices rallied even though they usually go down when production rises. ""People were pricing crude in the last couple of weeks (expecting) a bigger increase by OPEC than what they agreed to,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group. The European Union followed through on its promise to put import taxes on $3.4 billion in U.S. goods including bourbon, peanut butter and orange juice in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Automakers were jolted after President Donald Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tax on cars imported from Europe, although none of them took big losses. The S&P 500 index rose as much as 14 points but ended with a gain of just 5.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,754.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 119.19 points, or 0.5 percent, to 24,580.89 to break an eight-day losing streak. The Dow lost 2 percent this week, with Boeing off 5.3 percent and Caterpillar down 6.7 percent. That was both companies' biggest loss in three months. Makers of chemicals and other basic materials like 3M also lost ground this week and technology companies slipped. The Nasdaq composite fell 20.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,692.82. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 3.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,685.58. U.S. crude climbed 4.6 percent to $68.58 a barrel in New York. That was its biggest one-day gain since November 2016, when OPEC and a group of other countries including Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day. Prices have been rising since then, and U.S. crude hit a three-year high of about $72 a barrel in May. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 3.4 percent to $75.55 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil picked up 2.1 percent to $81.38 and Marathon Oil surged 7.8 percent to $21.48. The European Union is enforcing tariffs on $3.4 billion in U.S. products in retaliation for duties the Trump administration has put on European steel and aluminum. The taxes are on American products including bourbon, peanut butter and orange juice, and the choices appear designed to create political pressure on Trump and senior U.S. politicians. EU authorities had said the move was coming in response to the U.S. import duties. On Twitter, Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tax on cars imported from the EU if barriers to trade are not removed soon. He previously ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to look into possible tariffs or quotas on imported cars and car parts. That jolted car companies. In Germany, shares of BMW lost 1.1 percent and Daimler sank 0.3 percent. Daimler fell more than 4 percent Thursday after it said Chinese tariffs on U.S. cars would contribute to a decline in its earnings this year. Ford and Toyota also dipped while Peugeot and General Motors rose. ""If you're in the direct line of fire from a tariff, it's hugely important,"" said Paulsen. Still, he said investors are very skeptical that a damaging trade war will break out. ""The trade war has heated up over the last couple of months and yet stocks are up over that period of time,"" he said. That was also the case Friday. Health care and household goods companies also rose while technology companies and banks fell. Open source software maker Red Hat dropped 12.4 percent to $142.14 after it cut its sales forecasts due to the strengthening dollar. Other technology companies also declined. The industry has been leading the market for more than a year, but it makes more of its sales outside the U.S. than any other major S&P 500 sector. Micron Technology fell 3.9 percent to $57.10 and Nvidia lost 2.4 percent to $250.95. In other commodity trading, wholesale gasoline jumped 2.9 percent to $2.07 a gallon. Heating oil added 2.7 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Natural gas skidded 1 percent to $2.95 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold slid 0.3 percent to $1,270.70 an ounce. Silver added 0.8 percent to $16.46 an ounce.

The euro advanced to $1.1663 from $1.1617. The CAC 40 in France climbed 1.3 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1.7 percent. In Germany the DAX rose 0.5 percent.

1055,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Amazon's latest perk ... free delivery to your car. The Seattle company on Tuesday began offering delivery in 37 cities to Amazon Prime members who own newer General Motors or Volvo vehicles. The company will expand the number of locations as well as eligible vehicle makes and models going forward. Amazon has steadily expanded its reach into places long considered no-go zones for most people outside of the immediate family, starting with smart speakers in the home that await voice commands to come to life. Last year, Amazon launched Amazon Key which lets those who with a Wi-Fi-connected lock to unlock their front doors so that packages could be left inside. Earlier this year, the company acquired Ring, which makes Wi-Fi-connected cameras and doorbells. The in-car delivery service is available to members of Amazon Prime whose cars are parked in publicly accessible areas, such as on the street in front of an apartment building, at a workplace parking lot, or in a driveway. Amazon won't deliver to a private parking garage or other places where access to a vehicle is not readily available. Packages are placed in the vehicle's trunk or out of plain sight. Deliveries are available right now to Prime members with 2015 year or newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicles with GM's OnStar connected-car service, and those with a 2015 or newer Volvo vehicle with an active Volvo On Call account. Customers must download the Amazon Key app to which they can link a connected car. On the day a package is scheduled for delivery, customers can use the Amazon Key app to confirm that their car is parked in a place where a delivery can be made. The app also provides notifications with an expected 4-hour delivery window and notifies customers when the package is on its way and when it's been delivered. Customers can track when their car was unlocked and relocked through the app, where they can also rate the experience. ""Receiving a package securely and reliably in your car, without you having to be there, is something we think many people will appreciate,"" said Atif Rafiq, chief digital officer at Volvo Cars.

1079,"DETROIT (AP) — The competition for full-size pickup truck customers in the U.S. is as rough-and-tumble as ever, with Ram and Chevrolet rolling out brawny-looking new models that are larger, lighter and more efficient than their predecessors. For the first time in recent memory, two Detroit automakers are introducing new big trucks at the Motor City's auto show at the same time, in a hot sales market that U.S.-based automakers have dominated for years. Last year, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler and General Motors combined sold more than 2.2 million full-size trucks, controlling 93 percent of the segment. Big pickup truck sales are important to automakers, which make huge profits on them. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. One in every seven vehicles sold last year was a big pickup, up from one in every nine in 2009 in the midst of the Great Recession. Ford's F-Series pickup is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the GM's Chevy Silverado and Fiat-Chrysler's Ram. GM unveiled the Silverado Saturday night, while Fiat Chrysler is to roll out the new Ram Monday at the North American International Auto Show. Both are meaner-looking and bigger, but much lighter. Each has sophisticated engine or transmission improvements that give them better gas mileage as they go after the F-Series. Ford is countering that with its first diesel engine on the F-150, a 3-liter V6 that's expected to get 30 miles per gallon (12.8 kilometers per liter) on the highway. Style and performance are about the only ways the companies can differentiate themselves because quality has improved greatly, said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. ""They're giving the trucks more aggressive styling, which helps make them stand out,"" he said. ""Also they're giving them verifiable increases in performance."" The trend toward tougher-looking trucks started with the 1994 Ram, which changed from a conventional flat front with friendly round headlamps to rounded fenders with an outsized grille, and a hood and fenders that resembled a semi, Brauer said. The trend has continued as headlamps have switched to smaller, rectangular LEDs that allowed for even bigger grilles. GM market research shows that a meaner look appeals to truck buyers, who mainly are males. Eighty-three percent of big pickups in the U.S. are registered to males, according to data collected by IHS Markit. But women are gaining ground, making up 17 percent of registered owners last year from 14.7 percent in 2007. Sandor Piszar, Chevrolet's truck marketing manager, says buyers want the tough look, but the trucks also must have towing and off-road capability. ""They're mean-looking trucks, but they're trucks that can get the job done,"" he said. The 2019 Ram, due in showrooms before April 1, keeps the current beefy look, but it's 4 inches (10 centimeters) longer and slightly wider. The grille is larger, with a forward-leaning, aggressive slant. The hood was raised to evoke a big rig — and improve aerodynamics. Even the chrome Ram logo at the rear got a more chiseled, burly look. The new Ram also loses 225 pounds (102 kilograms) to compete with lightened rivals including the aluminum-clad F-150. The Ram frame is almost entirely lightweight, high-strength steel, and its tailgate and other bits are aluminum. But perhaps the most significant change a mild hybrid system, standard on most gasoline versions. The system replaces the alternator with a motor and a 48-volt battery pack, which can shut down the truck at stop lights to save fuel and boost acceleration. The system recaptures braking energy to charge the battery. FCA isn't releasing mileage but says it will be significantly better. The current Ram, redesigned in 2013, gets up to 25 mpg (10.6 kilometers per liter) highway with a gas engine or 27 (11.5 kilometers per liter) with a diesel. Michael Manley, head of the Ram and Jeep brands, said the mild hybrid system and lower weight should yield a 10 percent gas mileage improvement in the new truck. The Silverado, which goes on sale this fall, is up to 450 pounds (204 kilograms) lighter than the current model. Parts that swing, including doors, the hood and the tailgate, are lighter aluminum, but stationery parts such as the bed, are steel. The Silverado's frame also made high-strength steel. The truck gets two new V8 engines, 5.3-liters and 6.2-liters, that can shut off any number of cylinders to save gas but power them up when needed. There's also a new 3-liter six-cylinder diesel and a 10-speed automatic transmission available. The new Silverado is just under 2 inches (5 centimeters) longer than the old one for more cargo and interior space. It gets bigger fenders, a larger grille and sinister-looking but smaller rectangular headlamps. GM wouldn't release weight, fuel economy or price, but said the 450-pound loss is on a crew cab model with a V8. The current crew cab with a 6.2-liter V8 gets 20 mpg on the highway (8.5 kilograms per liter).",491,504,Auto Brand,282

The long-awaited trial begins Tuesday in Minneapolis. Experts say it could have wide-reaching implications if the state succeeds, in part because 3M and other companies legally dumped the chemicals for years in and outside Minnesota. The case focuses on the company's disposal of chemicals once used to make Scotchgard fabric protector and other products. The company denies it did anything wrong or illegal. The state alleges the chemicals damaged Minnesota's natural resources, including more than 100 miles of the Mississippi River, and contaminated drinking water, harmed wildlife and posed a threat to human health. PUERTO RICO-POWER COMPANY Judge grants $300M loan for Puerto Rico power company SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A federal judge has approved a $300 million loan for Puerto Rico's power company that officials say will help keep it operating until late March. Monday's ruling comes just days after the judge had rejected an initial $1 billion loan request made by a federal control board overseeing the U.S. territory's finances. The judge had said officials did not provide sufficient evidence proving Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority needed the money. Neither the board nor government officials immediately responded to a request for comment.

GM spokeswoman Mary Padilla says the announcement means the plant will keep about 500 jobs. The assembly plant currently employs 2,235, including about 2,000 hourly workers, making the Chevrolet Malibu. The company is spending $265 million to prepare to manufacture the vehicle. The Cadillac XT4 is a crossover SUV. The Kansas City Star reports Fairfax lost its third shift last fall after sales of the Malibu slumped. It had employed about 3,000 with the three shifts. CALIFORNIA MARIJUANA-UNLICENSED GROWERS Report: California pot growers lagging in getting licenses LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nearly two months after recreational marijuana became legal in California, less than 1 percent of the state's known growers have been licensed, according to a report released Monday by a pot industry group. The 38-page report from the California Growers Association says just 534 of an estimated 68,150 marijuana growers were licensed by the state as of Feb. 7. The association cited such obstacles to licensing as cost and regulatory barriers. A study published last year by the University of California Agricultural Issues Center estimated the newly created state market for recreational marijuana should produce $5 billion in taxable revenue this year. If more of the smaller, independent growers are not licensed by the state, taxable revenue of recreational marijuana is likely to be lower than anticipated as the black market continues to flourish, according to the new report.

1102,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors wants the U.S. government to exempt an SUV made in China from a 25 percent tariff imposed by the Trump administration. The automaker filed a request last month with the U.S. Trade Representative to exempt the Buick Envision, a midsize SUV with a starting price around $32,000. If granted, the SUV would be kept out of a growing trade war with China. GM President Dan Ammann says the Envision is a big seller in China but has relatively low sales in the U.S. He says the only way GM can sell it in the U.S. is to build it overseas. He says profits from the SUV are reinvested in the U.S. GM sold about 41,000 Envisions in the U.S. last year, while sales in China hit almost 211,000.",15,28,Auto Brand,284
1111,"BEIJING (AP) — Volkswagen and Nissan have unveiled electric cars designed for China at a Beijing auto show that highlights the growing importance of Chinese buyers for a technology seen as a key part of the global industry's future. General Motors displayed five all-electric models Wednesday including a concept Buick SUV it says can go 600 kilometers (375 miles) on one charge. Ford and other brands showed off some of the dozens of electric SUVs, sedans and other models they say are planned for China. Auto China 2018, the industry's biggest sales event this year, is overshadowed by mounting trade tensions between Beijing and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods including automobiles in a dispute over technology policy. The impact on automakers should be small, according to industry analysts, because exports amount to only a few thousand vehicles a year. Those include a GM SUV, the Envision, and Volvo Cars sedans made in China for export to the United States. China accounted for half of last year's global electric car sales, boosted by subsidies and other prodding from communist leaders who want to make their country a center for the emerging technology. ""The Chinese market is key for the international auto industry and it is key to our success,"" VW CEO Herbert Diess said on Tuesday. Volkswagen unveiled the E20X, an SUV that is the first model for SOL, an electric brand launched by the German automaker with a Chinese partner. The E20X, promising a 300-kilometer (185-mile) range on one charge, is aimed at the Chinese market's bargain-priced tiers, where demand is strongest. GM, Ford, Daimler AG's Mercedes unit and other automakers also have announced ventures with local partners to develop models for China that deliver more range at lower prices. On Wednesday, Nissan Motor Co. presented its Sylphy Zero Emission, which it said can go 338 kilometers (210 miles) on a charge. The Sylphy is based on Nissan's Leaf, a version of which is available in China but has sold poorly due to its relatively high price. Automakers say they expect electrics to account for 35 to over 50 percent of their China sales by 2025. First-quarter sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 154 percent over a year earlier to 143,000 units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That compares with sales of just under 200,000 for all of last year in the United States, the No. 2 market. That trend has been propelled by the ruling Communist Party's support for the technology. The party is shifting the financial burden to automakers with sales quotas that take effect next year and require them to earn credits by selling electrics or buy them from competitors. That increases pressure to transform electrics into a mainstream product that competes on price and features. Automakers also displayed dozens of gasoline-powered models from compact sedans to luxurious SUVs. Their popularity is paying for development of electrics, which aren't expected to become profitable for most producers until sometime in the next decade. China's total sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans reached 24.7 million units last year, compared with 17.2 million for the United States. SUVs are the industry's cash cow. First-quarter sales rose 11.3 percent over a year earlier to 2.6 million, or almost 45 percent of total auto sales, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. On Wednesday, Ford displayed its Mondeo Energi plug-in hybrid, its first electric model for China, which went on sale in March. Plans call for Ford and its luxury unit, Lincoln, to release 15 new electrified vehicles by 2025. GM plans to launch 10 electrics or hybrids in China from through 2020. VW is due to launch 15 electrics and hybrids in the next two to three years as part of a 10 billion euro ($12 billion) development plan announced in November. Nissan says it will roll out 20 electrified models in China over the next five years. New but fast-growing Chinese auto trail global rivals in traditional gasoline technology but industry analysts say the top Chinese brands are catching up in electrics, a market with no entrenched leaders. BYD Auto, the biggest global electric brand by number sold, debuted two hybrid SUVs and an electric concept car. The company, which manufactures electric buses at a California factory and exports battery-powered taxis to Europe, also displayed nine other hybrid and plug-in electric models. Chery Automobile Co. showed a lineup that included two electric sedans, an SUV and a hatchback, all promising 250 to 400 kilometers (150 to 250 miles) on a charge. They include futuristic features such as internet-linked navigation and smartphone-style dashboard displays. ""Our focus is not just an EV that runs. It is excellent performance,"" Chery CEO Chen Anning said in an interview ahead of the show. Electrics are likely to play a leading role as Chery develops plans announced last year to expand to Western Europe, said Chen. He said the company has yet to decide on a timeline. Chery was China's biggest auto exporter last year, selling 108,000 gasoline-powered vehicles abroad, though mostly in developing markets such as Russia and Egypt. ""We do have a clear intention to bring an EV product as one of our initial offerings"" in Europe, Chen said.",233,246,Auto Brand,285

1135,"DETROIT (AP) — Hyundai and Volkswagen each say they're partnering with a U.S. autonomous vehicle tech firm led by former executives from Google, Tesla and Uber. The companies on Thursday announced partnerships with Aurora Innovation, started last year by ex-Google autonomous car chief Chris Urmson and others. VW says its collaboration will help bring self-driving cars quickly to roads worldwide, while autonomous Hyundais are expected to be in the market by 2021. The partnerships are the latest in a string of tie-ups between traditional auto companies and tech firms as they race to be first with self-driving vehicles. Aurora is based in Pittsburgh and Palo Alto, California. It was started last year by Urmson, former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell. Terms of each partnership were not released, but Urmson, who is Aurora's CEO, said the startup will make a profit by helping Hyundai and VW develop safe autonomous vehicles. In an interview with The Associated Press, Urmson said he isn't sure exactly where money will be made in autonomous vehicles. It could be from developing sophisticated sensing and guidance systems, manufacturing vehicles or providing transportation as a service. ""The way the economics play out over time is still far from foregone,"" he said. ""We still don't know which of these pieces will be dominant or if they will find a happy equilibrium."" Urmson left Alphabet Inc.'s Google in 2016 after more than seven years of work on its autonomous vehicles. At Tesla Inc., Anderson led development of the company's semi-autonomous Autopilot system after its initial release, and he led development of the Model X SUV, according to Aurora's website. Bagnell was a founding member of Uber Technologies Inc.'s Advanced Technology Center that's working on autonomous cars in Pittsburgh. Germany-based Volkswagen AG, which produces about 10 million vehicles annually, hopes the tie-up will bring autonomous vehicle technology to all of its brands. The company says it has been working with Aurora for the past six months, integrating its sensors, hardware and software into VW vehicles. Hyundai Motor Co. said the partnership with Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to market that can operate without human input in most conditions. The partnership has yet to say how its first batch of self-driving vehicles will be used, but analysts expect they will likely be for commercial use, such as self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services, rather than for sales to individual consumers. General Motors said in November that its self-driving vehicles will carry passengers and deliver goods in big cities by 2019. Hyundai earlier joined with Cisco Systems Inc. and Baidu Inc. to collaborate on internet-connected cars. It has also set up a $45 million fund with South Korea's SK Telecom and Hanwha Asset Management to invest in artificial intelligence startups worldwide. The South Korean automaker plans to share more details of its project with Aurora during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, where it will also unveil the brand name of a new fuel-cell SUV that will be tested for self-driving technology.

1142,"BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group said Friday it is talking with China's biggest SUV maker about a possible partnership to produce electric versions of its MINI as automakers ramp up electric development under pressure from Beijing to meet sales quotas. BMW said it signed a letter of intent with Great Wall Motors Co., headquartered in Baoding, southwest of Beijing, and needs to work out a cooperation agreement and investment details. Auto brands face pressure to meet quotas that require electric vehicles to make up at least 10 percent of sales starting next year. Later, they face pressure to raise that to meet increasingly demanding fuel efficiency standards. Beijing is using access to its auto market, the world's largest, as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other electric vehicle technology. Foreign automakers that want to manufacture in China must do so through local partners, which requires them to hand over know-how or help potential Chinese competitors develop their own. General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG, Nissan Motor Co. and other brands already have announced similar plans with local partners to produce dozens of electric models for China. MINI's first battery electric model is due to be produced at its main British factory in Oxford in 2019, according to BMW. ""This signals a further clear commitment to the electrified future of the MINI brand,"" BMW said in a statement. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. China is BMW's biggest market. The Munich-based automaker said about 560,000 BMW brand vehicles were delivered to Chinese customers in 2017, more than its next two markets — the United States and Germany — combined. China was MINI's fourth-largest market in 2017, with 35,000 vehicles delivered, the company said. An electrics venture with BMW would be a boost for Great Wall, which industry analysts have warned will struggle to satisfy Beijing's sales quotas and had yet to announce any significant electric plans. Great Wall sells more than 1 million fuel-hungry SUVs annually. That sets a high baseline for electric sales and will make it harder to meet fleet average efficiency standards. ___ BMW Group: Great Wall Motors Co.:",1029,1042,Auto Brand,288

Wang Qiujing, president of GAC Engineering Institute China, said through an interpreter in an interview at the Detroit auto show that GAC picked the Chinese name Trumpchi in 2010, well before Trump was elected. Hee says the similarity to Trump is just a coincidence. GAC will continue to use Trumpchi in China, where the word means legend and good fortune. GAC's first vehicle in the U.S. will be the GS8, a loaded-out full-size SUV that will cost about $35,000. Two more vehicles are being researched for U.S. sales, but have not been selected yet. TRUMP-PANAMA FIGHT Panama Hotel votes to drop Trump — but his company won't go WASHINGTON (AP) — An attempt to oust President Donald Trump's hotel business from managing a luxury hotel in Panama has turned bitter, with accusations of financial misconduct. Trump Hotels is contesting its firing, and its staff ran off a team of Marriott executives invited last month to visit the property during a search for a new hotel operator, according to two people familiar with the matter. After the owners' association accused Trump Hotels of mismanagement and financial misconduct in a $15 million arbitration claim, the company owned by the president fired back with a $200 million counterclaim and refused to turn over the property's financial records. When a team from Marriott International Inc. came to the property at the invitation of the hotel's majority owner, Trump staff asked them to leave, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what happened behind the scenes. The two people say the head of Trump Hotels, Eric Danziger, also called Marriott chief executive Arne Sorenson to complain about the visit. Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten said the call was not intended to pressure Marriott. A spokeswoman for Marriott declined to comment.

1164,"DETROIT (AP) — The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opened to the press this week with one big question hanging in the air: How will autonomous vehicles change the industry? The answer is still unclear. In the meantime, automakers continue to put out new vehicles of all shapes and sizes, including small cars, SUVs and the all-mighty pickup truck, which dominated the show. All will be on display when the show opens to the public Saturday, with a charity preview on Friday night. Here are five things we learned from the preview this week: TRUCKS ARE KING Pickups are the most popular vehicles in the U.S., and trucks unveiled at the show make clear that will continue for a long time. General Motors spent heavily to update its top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup, cutting up to 450 pounds of weight by using more aluminum and lighter high-strength steel. The truck also gets two new V8 engines that can run on one to eight cylinders depending on how much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler's Ram also got big updates, losing more than 200 pounds and giving it a gas-electric hybrid engine option. Both the Silverado and Ram were given more athletic stances and meaner looks. Ford added a diesel engine to its F-150 and rolled out the midsize Ranger. Automakers turn big profits on large pickups. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. Ford's F-Series is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the Silverado and Ram. TAX REFORM BOOST? U.S. auto sales are likely to fall to around 16.7 million in 2018 from 17.2 million last year, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. But that would still make it one of the 10 best sales years in history, so the market remains strong. U.S. income tax code changes this year may stimulate new auto sales, but any increase likely will be offset by rising interest rates and the abundant supply of late-model used cars that pull buyers from new vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp.'s top North American executive says. North American CEO Jim Lentz expects a sales boost of 200,000 vehicles as tax cuts put more money in people's pockets. But the increase could be negated as rising rates keep some people on the sidelines, and some buyers opt for a lower-cost but nice off-lease used car. Tax cuts could boost pickup truck sales because businesses can write off the expenses immediately under the new code, Lentz said. But he expects luxury new-car sales to be flat this year even though tax rates were reduced for higher-income earners. Any decrease could be wiped out by caps on deductions for mortgage interest and local and state taxes in big luxury-car states such as New York and California, Lentz said. TRADE DEAL Many auto executives interviewed at the auto show say they're afraid the U.S. might pull out of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, but they can't prepare for it because they don't know what, if anything will replace it. In ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada, the Trump administration is seeking to ensure that more vehicles are made in America, among other changes. But Jim Lentz, Toyota's North American CEO, says ending the agreement would likely raise costs. That, in turn, would raise vehicle prices and cut demand, forcing manufacturing layoffs. It also would make the U.S. less competitive than the world's other manufacturing centers, he said. Ending the agreement also could force some suppliers to stop making parts. Charlie Chesbrough, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, said it's hard to imagine there will be much change in production, because automakers need a long lead time to act and they know the next president could reverse Trump's actions. But some automakers are already taking pre-emptive steps to show the administration they're willing to boost U.S. production. Fiat Chrysler said ahead of the auto show that it will move heavy duty truck production from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. HEDGING ON ROBOT CARS Automakers are hedging their bets when it comes to autonomous vehicles and whether they will someday cut into or even end personal car ownership. In interviews through the week, executives said they're preparing for a time when people hire self-driving ride services to get around instead of spending on personal vehicles. But they don't know just when that will take place, so they also must continue to spend millions to develop conventional vehicles as well. ""These proclamations that we hear about the advent of electrification and artificial intelligence ... are all things that, at best, are conjecture,"" said Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Although some companies plan to deploy driverless cars to carry passengers in coming months, Marchionne says it will take years for the vehicles to be in widespread use. Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development says he wishes he knew exactly when and where the switch would take place. But for now, GM and other companies have to be in both places. ""We can go either way and that agility is priceless,"" said Reuss. GOOD OLD DAYS Despite the new wheels on the show floor, one of the biggest hits is a 50-year-old Mustang GT fastback in need of a paint job.

1193,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is making Miami-Dade County its new test bed for self-driving vehicles. The automaker and its partners — Domino's Pizza, ride-hailing company Lyft and delivery company Postmates — are starting pilot programs to see how consumers react to autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Self-driving startup and Ford partner Argo AI already has a fleet of cars in the area making the highly detailed maps that are necessary for self-driving. Ford also will establish its first-ever autonomous vehicle terminal in Miami, where it will learn how to service and deploy its test fleet. More services will likely be introduced as the partnership goes on, including Chariot, an app-based shuttle service owned by Ford. It's all part of Ford's effort to find viable business models for fully autonomous vehicles and get them on the road by 2021. ""This is, I think, the future of any automotive company or mobility company. If a majority of the world's population is going to be living in cities, we need to understand how to move those people around,"" said John Kwant, Ford's vice president of city solutions, who inked the deal with Miami-Dade. Ford isn't the first automaker to run test fleets of autonomous vehicles. General Motors Co. will start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City this year, while Nissan Motor Co. is launching an autonomous taxi service in Yokohama, Japan, next week. Technology companies like Waymo — a division of Google — are also testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in Phoenix, San Francisco and Singapore, among other cities. But the partnership with a specific metropolitan is less common. Both sides envision a deep relationship where Ford can help Miami-Dade solve specific issues, like how to most efficiently move people from its suburbs to its downtown monorail, and Miami-Dade can offer solutions like dedicated lanes for automated vehicles or infrastructure projects like advanced traffic lights that can send signals to connected cars. ""We want to be on the forefront of this because we want to give our people choices,"" said Carlos Gimenez, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, which is home to 34 cities and 2.7 million people. Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, says the company also intends to work closely with local businesses. The company wants to learn, for example, how a florist might use an autonomous delivery vehicle. ""Autonomous vehicle technology is interesting, but it's a whole lot more interesting with a viable business model,"" he said. The city of Miami is the fifth-most congested in the U.S., according to a recent traffic study by the consulting firm Inrix. After more than a century of selling people vehicles, Kwant says Ford now wants to figure out ways to move people more efficiently in order to cut down on that time in traffic. Sam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst with the consulting firm Navigant Research, says Ford and others must figure out how to make money on self-driving cars. ""If this does take off, if people do adopt automated vehicles and use them for ride-hailing, that's going to result in a decline in retail vehicle sales,"" Abuelsamid said. ""They need to figure out, if we're going to have a decline in the number of vehicles we sell to consumers, how do we keep our business stable?"" Kwant says the testing will also help Ford determine what its future self-driving vehicles need to look like and how they must perform. ""If you don't have steering wheels, how do you begin to use that package space? How do you begin to look different in terms of carrying more people?"" he said. Ford won't say how many vehicles it will have on the road in Miami-Dade, but says it will be Ford's largest test bed for autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. All of the vehicles will have backup safety drivers. Domino's experimental vehicles aren't even technically autonomous; they're equipped to be, but for now they have actual drivers. The windows are blacked out so customers can experience how to get pizza from the car without dealing with a person. Miami will give Ford new challenges. Previously, it tested Domino's cars in suburban Michigan, where parking wasn't an issue. But in busy Miami Beach, the cars will have to figure out where they can go to allow apartment-dwellers to safely retrieve their pizzas. An autonomous delivery vehicle from Postmates might have to switch between Spanish and English commands when it picks up a meal and delivers it to a customer. Self-driving Lyft vehicles will be tasked with mapping out the best places to wait for customers without causing more traffic headaches. Kwant says Ford will announce more city partnerships as this year progresses. But Miami-Dade was a natural, since it has good weather, lots of different urban and suburban terrain and support from Gimenez and other government leaders. Gimenez, who began talking to Ford in 2017 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, says he's not worried about consumer acceptance of self-driving cars. He thinks his community will embrace them as companies prove that shared autonomous vehicles can be cheaper and safer than regular ones. Gimenez says self-driving vehicles also can potentially improve traffic flow without significant new investments in roadways. They can travel more closely together, for example, because they're always watching the car in front of them and can brake automatically. ""That's why I'm really high on this technology,"" he said.",1235,1248,Auto Brand,206

WILMINGTON TRUST-BANK FRAUD Jury deliberations begin in fraud trial of bank executives WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Jury deliberations have begun in the federal fraud and conspiracy case against four former executives of the only financial institution to be criminally charged in connection with the federal bank bailout program. Jurors began deliberating around midday Wednesday after attorneys for the former Wilmington Trust executives finished closing arguments and prosecutors offered a brief rebuttal. Former bank president Robert V.A. Harra Jr., former chief credit officer William North, former chief financial officer David Gibson and former controller Kevyn Rakowski are charged with fraud, conspiracy and making false statements to federal regulators. Prosecutors allege that in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis the defendants deliberately misled regulators and investors about the bank's massive amount of past-due commercial real estate loans before the century-old institution was hastily sold in 2011. TRUMP-LAWSUIT NY appeals court asked to overturn Trump businesses' ruling NEW YORK (AP) — A federal appeals court in New York has been asked to reinstate a lawsuit that claims President Donald Trump has business conflicts that violate the Constitution. Lawyers for restaurant workers and restaurants that compete with Trump's businesses asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday to let their claims go forward. A lower-court judge tossed them out in December, saying it was an issue better left to Congress to resolve. The lawyers wrote on appeal that Trump has acted unlawfully by accepting profits from foreign and domestic officials through his hotels and restaurants while in office. They say that's illegal unless Congress consents. They say he has consistently used his position to advertise his properties, in part by visiting one of them every three days on average. GENERAL MOTORS-FACTORY JOBS General Motors to add 700 workers at Tennessee factory DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is adding a shift at a Tennessee factory that makes GMC and Cadillac SUVs, putting about 700 people to work. But there may not be any new hires in Spring Hill south of Nashville. Some laid-off workers at the factory will be rehired and others furloughed from an Ohio factory could relocate. GM spokeswoman Kim Carpenter says the company is still working on a staffing plan for the third shift, which begins in September. The Spring Hill plant now employs about 2,600 hourly workers on two shifts. They make the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5. Earlier this month GM said it will eliminate a shift at its Chevy Cruze plant near Cleveland that could cost up to 1,500 jobs. The move is due to slowing compact car sales. EARNS-TWITTER Twitter is profitable again in 1st quarter, grows overseas SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Twitter swung to a profit during the first quarter of the year, driven by growth overseas. It's the company's second profitable quarter ever after a strong finish last year. But its stock tumbled more than 6 percent when the market opened. For the three months ended March 31, Twitter Inc. earned $61 million, or 8 cents per share. A year earlier the San Francisco company lost $61.6 million, or 9 cents per share. Removing certain items, earnings were 16 cents per share. That's 4 cents better than what analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected. Revenue was $664.9 million, easily beating analyst projections of $609.9 million. Twitter has been dealing with several broader problems. It's struggled to get people to sign up, partly because anyone can read tweets without signing up. As a result, Twitter's user base pales compared with Facebook and the Facebook-owned Instagram. Twitter has also wrestled with hate speech and abusive comments, fake accounts and attempts by Russian agents to spread misinformation on the site.

NESTLE-US CANDY SALE Nestle selling US candy business for $2.9 billion NEW YORK (AP) — Swiss food and drink giant Nestle is selling its U.S. candy business to Italy's Ferrero for about $2.9 billion in cash. Ferrero will take over iconic chocolate brands Butterfinger and Crunch bars, as well as the sugary Nerds, SweeTarts and FunDip. After a review of its portfolio last summer, Nestle hinted that it might sell its U.S. business, with its eye on higher-growth areas like pet care, coffee and infant nutrition. In September, Nestle announced that it bought a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, a high-end coffee company. Other Nestle brands include Purina, Gerber and Stouffer's.

HOLIDAY SALES-ONLINE Holiday shoppers spent record amount online NEW YORK (AP) — Shoppers spent a record amount online during the holiday season. That's according to Adobe Analytics, which reports online shopping during the holiday season reached $108.2 billion, up almost 15 percent from $94.4 billion the year before. The research arm of software maker Adobe says more than a third of online holiday revenue came from purchases made on smartphones or tablets. Adobe Analytics says people likely spent more due to low unemployment rates and a strong stock market. Last week, the National Retail Federation said in-store and online holiday spending rose 5.5. percent, the strongest gain since the Great Recession. EARNS-CITIGROUP Citigroup reports $18.3 billion loss, caused by new tax law NEW YORK (AP) — Citigroup lost $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter as the bank had to take more than $20 billion in accounting write-downs related to the new tax law. The bank had a loss of $7.15 a share, compared with a profit of $3.57 billion, or $1.14 a share, in the same period a year ago. Citigroup wrote off $19 billion in deferred tax assets, which are credits Citi could have used toward future years. Because the new tax law lowered corporate tax rates, those credits aren't worth as much and Citi, like other major U.S. banks, had to write down their value. The bank also took a $3 billion charge for foreign earnings it will bring back to the U.S. Excluding those charges, Citi earned $3.7 billion, or $1.28 a share.

UnitedHealth now expects adjusted earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share in 2018, up from its initial forecast for $10.55 to $10.85 per share. FactSet says analysts forecast earnings of $11.44 per share. UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings climbed to $3.62 billion, as total revenue climbed over 9 percent to $52.06 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.59 per share, excluding the tax overhaul gain. Analysts expected $2.51 per share on $51.54 billion in revenue for the Minnetonka, Minnesota, company, which is the first big insurer to report results every quarter.

1221,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The widow of maverick automaker John DeLorean has alleged in a lawsuit that a Texas company illegally received money from the ""Back to the Future"" movies that used his iconic car. The sleek, angular car with gull-wing doors known simply as ""the DeLorean,"" was featured in the 1985 movie starring Michael J. Fox and a 1989 sequel, about a kid who travels back in time to engineer his parents' meeting. The lawsuit filed this week in federal court in Newark includes a contract with Universal from 1989 that gave DeLorean 5 percent of net receipts for any merchandising that featured the car and logo ""as a key component."" According to the suit, the Texas company, called DeLorean Motor Company, represented to Universal that it had the right to the money and has already received ""a substantial payment"" from Universal. The Texas company isn't affiliated with the one DeLorean started. Sally DeLorean, who lives in New Jersey, settled a lawsuit in 2015 allowing the company to use the DeLorean name and trademarks. That agreement didn't transfer contractual rights to the company, the current lawsuit contends. Attorneys didn't return messages on Wednesday. John Z. DeLorean was an automotive innovator who began his career at General Motors Co. and is credited by some with creating America's first ""muscle"" car, the Pontiac GTO, in the mid-1960s. He left GM in the early 1970s to launch his own company that eventually produced the DMC 12. Only about 9,000 of the cars were produced before the company went bankrupt in the early 1980s, but the car's look and cult following helped land it a role in the ""Back to the Future"" series. The car was chosen because it would plausibly look like a spacecraft to people in the 1950s flashback scenes, according to the Internet Movie Database. DeLorean died in 2005, after years of court battles that included a highly publicized drug trial in the early 1980s in which he was acquitted of conspiring to sell $24 million of cocaine. His former estate in the rolling hills about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York was converted into a golf course by then-developer Donald Trump in 2004.",1246,1259,Auto Brand,297

1246,"DETROIT (AP) — Because these days you can't have too many SUVs, General Motors is bringing back the Chevrolet Blazer. Only this time it's not a thirsty and boxy truck like its predecessor, one of the original SUVs that was sold from the 1982 through 2005 model years. SUVs based on car underpinnings, sometimes called crossover vehicles, are what buyers want these days, and the Chevy brand didn't have a midsize one with two rows of seats to compete with the popular Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano. So GM on Thursday unveiled the sculpted Blazer in Atlanta, trying to capitalize on a well-known name that has a lot of equity, said Steve Majoros, Chevy's director of car and crossover marketing. ""There's still a number of people that either have good positive feelings about that product or still have them in their driveways,"" he said. At its peak in 1996, Chevrolet sold just over 246,000 Blazers. The new Blazer, to be made at GM's Ramos Arizpe factory in Mexico, is far from a box. It sits relatively low to the ground and has futuristic creases on the sides and a low-angle windshield to give it a sporty look. Chevy says it will come standard with a 193-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, with an optional 305 horsepower 3.6-liter V6. All models will have stop-start technology that shuts off the engine at red traffic lights, plus nine-speed automatic transmissions that will help gas mileage. Gas mileage and price weren't released by GM. Chevy hopes to take a chunk out of Grand Cherokee sales, one of the more popular and profitable vehicles in the Jeep lineup, in the growing midsize SUV segment. Last year Fiat Chrysler sold nearly 159,000 Grand Cherokees. The choice to build the Blazer in Mexico brought a rebuke from the United Auto Workers union, which said in a statement that GM is building the SUV south of the border while GM workers in the U.S. are laid off and unemployed. The Blazer also could get caught up in a potential trade war, with President Donald Trump threatening tariffs on imported vehicles. GM said the decision to build in Mexico was made years ago and that the Blazer's engines are made in the U.S. The Blazer, due in showrooms early next year, comes as American buyers continue their shift from cars to trucks and SUVs. This year trucks and SUVs accounted for about two-thirds U.S. new-vehicle sales, with cars making up the rest.",64,77,Auto Brand,299
1257,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales rose 7.9 percent in May from a year earlier as purchases of electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled to 102,000, an industry group reported Tuesday. Sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans rose to 1.9 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 9.6 percent to 2.3 million. Year-to-date sales rose 5.1 percent to 9.9 million, rebounding from 2017's annual growth of just 1.4 percent. Sales of electric and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 126 percent over a year earlier. Through May, sales of electrics and hybrids rose 142 percent to 328,000. Beijing has spent heavily to transform China into the world's biggest electric car market and is preparing to enforce sales quotas to press global automakers to speed up development. The Finance Ministry says auto import duties will be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent on most vehicles, effective July 1. That followed pledges to buy more U.S. goods and end restrictions on foreign ownership in the industry. Ford Motor Co. responded by announcing a cut in prices of imported models. But industry analysts say automakers including Ford, General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG are likely to gain little in sales, because most of their vehicles sold in China are produced in local factories. The tariff cut is likely to benefit high-end European and Japanese brands such as BMW AG, VW's Audi unit and Toyota Motor Co.'s Lexus that import more of their vehicles, as well as Tesla, the electric car brand that has no China factory, according to industry analysts. — Nissan Motor Co. sales rose 14.3 percent to 128,059. For the five months through May, sales gained 10.8 percent to 589,409. — Toyota sales rose 10.9 percent to 122,400. Year-to-date sales gained 10.9 percent to 562,200. — Volkswagen AG said May sales rose 4.1 percent to 251,600. Sales so far this year are up 7.9 percent at 1.2 million. — BMW AG said sales of BMW and MINI brand vehicles shrank 10.1 percent to 45,860.

1268,"Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has delivered on its CEO's promise to build a lower-priced car at a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of June. CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to company employees Sunday praising them for producing 5,000 Model 3s, a compact car that's designed to shift Tesla from a niche manufacturer to a mainstream automaker. Musk also said the company had cranked out a combined 2,000 of Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles, bringing overall production to a record 7,000 for the week. ""We did it!"" Musk wrote. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team."" The e-mail was reported by the website Electrek, and the company confirmed its authenticity. Last summer, when the first Model 3s began rolling off the assembly line, Musk promised to build 5,000 per week by December and 10,000 per week in 2018. But he also warned at the time that Tesla was entering at least six months of ""manufacturing hell"" as it tried to hit the targets. Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at the market research firm AutoPacific Inc., wasn't impressed. ""Reaching it is one thing,"" Sullivan said. ""Consistently producing 5,000 per week with outstanding quality is another. I don't think producing 5,000 once is anything to get excited about until it's repeatable."" Model 3 sales are critical to Tesla's future. The company has never posted a full-year profit, and it burned through more than $1 billion in cash in the first quarter. Wall Street investors, who have pushed the company's stock beyond $340 per share, are growing impatient with the losses. Moody's Investor Service downgraded Tesla's debt into junk territory back in March, warning that Tesla won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla said cash from Model 3 sales will pay the bills and drive profits. The company reached 5,000 per week as Musk spent many nights inside the Fremont, California, factory that once belonged to a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota. To quickly put another assembly line in place, Tesla built a large tent at the factory site. Musk told investors on a first-quarter earnings conference call that the company relied too heavily on automation. It had to hire more people to work at the factory. Tesla said in April that it had about 450,000 orders for the Model 3. But some could be getting antsy, especially those who want a price closer to the base of $35,000. Currently Tesla is selling only Model 3s that cost $49,000 to in excess of $70,000. Many have been waiting since March of 2016, when Tesla began taking orders with a $1,000 refundable deposit. The company also may have to deal with some safety issues. Investigators from two federal agencies are looking into five crashes of its vehicles, some involving the semi-autonomous Autopilot system or post-crash battery fires that have been difficult to extinguish. But regardless of those issues, Musk was in a celebratory mood Sunday. ""I think we just became a real car company,"" he wrote. ___ AP Business Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this story.",2010,2023,Auto Brand,301

1358,"TOKYO (AP) — Honda Motor Co. of Japan and U.S. automaker General Motors Co. agreed Thursday to work together in developing batteries for electric vehicles, mainly for the North American market. The companies will collaborate based on GM's next-generation battery system, both sides said. That will allow both manufacturers to continue to keep distinct products, while saving on costs for customers, they said. Detroit-based GM and Tokyo-based Honda already work together on fuel cell vehicles, which are zero-emission and run on the power created when hydrogen fuel combines with oxygen in the air to produce water. They have a manufacturing joint venture to produce a hydrogen fuel cell system in 2020, including trying to make fuel cells and hydrogen storage more affordable. They also both have electric vehicles in their model lineup. Pressure is growing on automakers to become more environmentally friendly as well as develop other technology for vehicles such as semi-autonomous driving. Nissan Motor Co., one of the leaders in electric vehicles, is working with partner Renault SA of France on electric vehicle technology, while Toyota Motor Corp. is working with Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp. ""This new, multiyear agreement with Honda further demonstrates General Motors' capability to innovate toward a profitable electric portfolio,"" said Mark Reuss, General Motors Executive Vice President. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at Her work can be found at",57,70,Auto Brand,308
1363,"DETROIT (AP) — Japanese air bag maker Takata is recalling an additional 3.3 million faulty air bag inflators as it expands the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. The latest recalls cover frontal air bags in certain 2009, 2010 and 2013 vehicles made Honda, Toyota, Audi, BMW, Daimler Vans, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Tesla. Automakers will provide specific models in paperwork that will be filed later this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Notices of the expanded recalls were posted Saturday . Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 20 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection. The recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority. Many automakers have been slow to replace the potentially deadly inflators. A report by an independent monitor said that as of Sept. 15, 2017, automakers have recalled 43.1 million inflators. Of those, only 18.5 million, or 43 percent, have been replaced even though Takata recalls began in 2001. NHTSA has said the Takata recalls are unprecedented in size and complexity and have resulted in groundbreaking lessons that will help automakers reach their repair goals. The agency said it is monitoring the automakers' progress and working to expand best practices to boost completion rates. The agency also has the authority to fine automakers that don't make recall repairs in a timely manner.",318,331,Auto Brand,309

GM spokeswoman Kim Carpenter says the company is still working on a staffing plan for the third shift, which begins in September. The Spring Hill plant now employs about 2,600 hourly workers on two shifts. They make the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5. Earlier this month GM said it will eliminate a shift at its Chevy Cruze plant near Cleveland that could cost up to 1,500 jobs. The move is due to slowing compact car sales.",15,28,Auto Brand,272

1376,"MILAN (AP) — Sergio Marchionne, the founding CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles who died Wednesday, was widely recognized as an industry leader. Here's a look at some of his biggest accomplishments. ___ CREATING VALUE Since taking over Fiat in 2004, Marchionne has increased the company's market value more than tenfold. Fiat's share price rose from 1.4 euros ($1.64) to as much as 20 euros ($23.4) this year. That increase reflects the takeover of Chrysler but also the spinoff of key units, like Ferrari. ___ GETTING CASH FROM GM The move that made Marchionne's name as a dealmaker was getting General Motors to pay $2 billion in 2005 to sever ties with Fiat. The two companies had had a legal contract by which Fiat could have forced GM to buy out the company. GM was afraid of taking on Fiat's debt. So Marchionne convinced it to pay the divorce fee instead — money that helped Fiat get back on its feet. ___ BUYING CHRYSLER FOR NOTHING In 2009, as CEO of Fiat, Marchionne struck an agreement to take over Chrysler without putting down a penny. In exchange, it offered its small-car technology, which Chrysler had been lacking. That saved Chrysler from liquidation and since then it has become the profit-leader in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. ___ SPINOFFS Marchionne unlocked wealth by spinning off subsidiaries, above all the sports car and racing unit Ferrari and the construction vehicles manufacturer CNH. Ferrari is now worth 27 billion euros ($32 billion) and CNH about 18 billion euros ($21 billion).",594,607,Auto Brand,311

1384,"DETROIT (AP) — January's U.S. auto sales were a little better than a year ago, but most analysts and automakers predict a small full-year decline despite economic factors that favor the industry. Automakers reported a 1 percent increase last month to 1.15 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. But Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, the country's largest dealership group, said late-model used cars coming off leases are pulling buyers from higher-priced new vehicles. Despite tax reform, low unemployment and strong consumer confidence, he sees new-car sales falling to 16.8 million from last year's 17.2 million. During the past few years, automakers pushed leasing to around 30 percent of sales. Now, Jackson says 4 million well-equipped used cars will be available for an average price of $25,000. ""You have to say 'who is going to buy all these things when they come back?'"" Jackson said. ""Of course there's going to be a cannibalization and a substitution."" Car sales fell nearly 11 percent while truck and SUV sales were up 8 percent. Here are the numbers released by automakers Thursday: — Honda Motor Co. said sales were down 1.7 percent to 104,542. Truck and SUV sales fell 2.5 percent while cars were off just under 1 percent. The CR-V small SUV, in the hottest part of the market, saw a 16.9 percent sales drop. — Hyundai Motor Co. sales fell 11.3 percent from last year's record January, to 39,629. The car-heavy Korean automaker saw Sonata midsize sedan sales tumble 23.7 percent. — Nissan Group sales rose 10 percent to 123,538, a January record. Sales were led by the Rogue small SUV, which was up nearly 26 percent to more than 36,000. Nissan brand sales rose 12 percent but Infiniti luxury sales dropped 8 percent. — Ford Motor Co. sales fell 6.6 percent to 161,143, due in part to a decline in sales to rental car fleets. But its average vehicle sales price hit a record $37,000, largely due to a 1.6 percent sales increase for the higher priced F-Series pickup. Car sales were down 23.3 percent. — General Motors Co. sales rose 1 percent to 198,548. Buick and Chevrolet posted gains, but GMC and Cadillac saw lower sales. GM's best-seller, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup, saw a 14.5 percent jump. A new Silverado goes on sale later this year, so GM is discounting the outgoing truck. — Toyota Motor Corp. posted a 16.8 percent increase to 167,056 vehicles on strong demand for the RAV4, Highlander and 4Runner SUVs, which hit January sales records. Sales of the revamped Camry midsize car rose 21.3 percent, bucking the SUV trend. — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were down 13 percent due to reduced sales to fleet buyers. The company sold nearly 133,000 vehicles, led by a 2 percent increase in Jeep sales. But the Chrysler brand fell 21 percent while Dodge was off 31 percent and Fiat dropped 43 percent. The Ram truck brand fell 16 percent. — Subaru posted a 1.1 percent gain to 44,357 vehicles on record January sales of Crosstrek and Outback SUVs. — Volkswagen sales were up 5.2 percent to 24,744. Combined sales of the new Atlas large SUV and Tiguan small SUV hit 10,640, accounting for 43 percent of VW's sales. ____ This story has been corrected to show that last year's auto sales were 17.2 million.",2024,2037,Auto Brand,313
1395,"LORDSTOWN, Ohio (AP) — With too many factories making slow-selling cars, General Motors can't afford to keep them all operating without making some tough decisions. But the political atmosphere might be limiting its options. A possible scenario, analysts say, is to close its sprawling Lordstown plant in northeastern Ohio because the compact car it makes also is built in Mexico. The once-bustling factory already has lost two of its three shifts and 3,000 union jobs since the beginning of last year. But moving that car, the Chevrolet Cruze, south of the border brings the risk of provoking a backlash and tweetstorm from President Donald Trump. And GM also isn't sure whether he'll make good on threats to impose 25 percent tariffs on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico. Also at issue is that the Cruze plant just outside Youngtown is in a Democratic and labor stronghold, where Trump won over a surprising number of voters two years ago by reaching out to what he called America's ""forgotten men and women."" At a rally near the plant last summer, Trump talked about passing by big factories whose jobs ""have left Ohio,"" then told people not to sell their homes because the jobs are ""coming back. They're all coming back."" Altogether, GM has five car factories with plenty of unused capacity in Kansas City, Kansas; Lordstown; and Detroit-Hamtramck, Lansing, and Orion Township, Michigan. Three are running on one shift per day, which is inefficient and costs GM money. Automakers like to run plants on at least two daily shifts. To deal with the overcapacity, GM will either have to eat the added costs, close one or more plants, or retool them to build trucks and SUVs that now are favored by U.S. buyers. GM's closest competitors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford, plan to scrap most car models and convert plants to trucks and SUVs. GM, however, recently revamped much of its car lineup and banked on sales stabilizing. But last month, trucks and SUVs reached a record 68 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. In the U.S., automakers have enough factory capacity to build about 14 million vehicles per year, but last year they manufactured only 11 million. More than one-third of that idle capacity — 1.3 million vehicles — is in the five GM car plants that are operating at 37 percent capacity, said Kristin Dziczek, a vice president at the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. GM car plants are operating at 37 percent of their capacity, she said. Many truck and SUV plants, however, several of which run three shifts a day, are at 105 percent capacity. So that leaves the automaker with the three choices: Run plants under capacity and risk reduced profits, close at least one plant and move its product to another, or move products to the U.S. from other countries, mainly Mexico, to fill the underused factories. Dziczek thinks GM will take the final choice, converting car plants to trucks and SUVs, especially if the Trump administration slaps 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles. GM, which imports some of its profit-rich pickup trucks from Silao, Mexico, and SUVs from China, would be hard-pressed to absorb the tariff cost. So in order to say competitive, it would move, Dziczek said. ""They'd look to convert as much as they can to build what everyone is buying,"" she said. Moving products back to the U.S. could keep the car factories open and save existing jobs. If enough vehicles came back from other countries, the companies could add jobs. Currently, the five GM plants have about 7,400 hourly workers. While all this plays out, there's plenty of angst in Lordstown, where the GM plant is one of the region's few remaining industrial anchors. UAW Local 1112 President Dave Green said he's not sure what Trump's threat of tariffs will mean for the plant's future. ""I don't necessarily have a lot of faith that our president knows what he's doing,"" Green said. ""I'm a little concerned he may be just shooting from the hip."" While the UAW nationally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, many Lordstown workers, including Eric Vasko, voted for Trump. ""He said he would bring work back to the United States to keep it from going to Mexico,"" said Vasko, who has worked at Lordstown for the past 18 years. ""I'm sure a lot of people voted for him because of that."" Two of Ohio's most prominent Democrats — U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Rep. Tim Ryan, who represents the Youngstown area — both said they have talked with GM CEO Mary Barra but came away without any commitment to keeping the Lordstown plant running. What really angered Ryan and the plant's workers was that on the day Lordstown's second shift ended in June, GM announced plans to build its new Chevrolet Blazer in Mexico. ""Salt in the wound,"" Ryan said. ""That's what upsets you; that's what gets you fired up."" GM spokeswoman Kim Carpenter would say only that the company is continually looking at global operations ""for greater efficiency and capacity utilization."" Although GM could convert some car plants and add new SUVs, that won't be enough to utilize all of its excess car-building capacity, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid. ""In all likelihood we'll almost certainly see one, maybe two plants closing,"" he said. Further complicating GM's factory dilemma is the United Auto Workers, which has a contract that expires next year. Closing a plant before negotiations could bring a national strike, or could provoke a strike during the contract talks. Already the UAW's leadership has taken a harder line than in the past, blasting GM's decision to build a new version of the Chevrolet Blazer SUV in Mexico when U.S. workers at car plants are unemployed. ""GM employs over 15,000 production workers in Mexico, pays the workers less than $3 per hour and exports over 80 percent of the vehicles to the U.S. to sell here,"" new Vice President for GM Terry Dittes said in a statement. ""This is all happening while UAW-GM workers here in the U.S are laid off."" ___ Krisher reported from Detroit. Seewer reported from Toledo.",73,86,Auto Brand,314

In a hastily called Rose Garden appearance with Trump, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the U.S. and the EU agreed to hold off on new tariffs, suggesting that the United States will suspend plans to start taxing European auto imports — a move that would have marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the allies. ___ Facebook reports slower-than-expected 2Q revenue growth NEW YORK (AP) — There's a scratch in Facebook's Teflon coating. The social network's user base and revenue grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter as the company grappled with privacy issues, sending its stock tumbling after hours. The company also warned that it expects revenue growth to decelerate in the next couple of quarters as it promotes new, and for now less profitable, products— such as its Stories disappearing message feature. It is also allowing users to make ""more choices"" around data privacy amid public outcry and regulatory pressures. The earnings covered the company's first full quarter since the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal erupted. ___ Trump's Scottish resort to expand, raising ethics concerns NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump's company is planning a major expansion of one of its golf resorts in Britain that would include the construction and sale of 500 homes fetching as much as several million dollars each, raising possible conflict-of-interest issues as his administration faces tricky trade negotiations with the country. The Trump Organization says it submitted plans to local Scottish officials on Tuesday for permission to spend nearly $200 million (150 million pounds) building The Trump Estate, a residential community of 500 luxury cottages and mansions. Ethics lawyers have said that any expansion there requiring government approval raises the possibility Trump's business could get special favors. ___ Tariffs force some automakers to dim earnings outlook DETROIT (AP) — An escalating trade war and steep tariffs on steel and aluminum is putting pressure on earnings for automakers, prompting General Motors to slash its outlook while also weighing down shares of Ford Motor Co. GM cited ""recent and significant increases in commodity costs"" for why it now expects 2018 profits of $5.14 a share, down from its previous forecast of $6 and below analysts' expectation of $6.42. Ford's shares were slumping all day. The company reported a 48 percent decline in second-quarter net earnings after the market closed, due largely to a fire at a parts factory that cut into lucrative pickup truck sales. ___ Qualcomm calls off $44B deal for NXP, which lacks Chinese OK SAN DIEGO (AP) — Qualcomm says it will drop its $44 billion deal to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors by the end of the day Wednesday, a high-profile victim of the rising trade tensions between the U.S and China. Instead, the San Diego-based chipmaker says it will pay a $2 billion break-up fee and spend up to $30 billion buying back its own stock. Qualcomm had once hailed the deal, first announced in 2016, as a way to break into markets for automobiles, security and network processing. But the company said the agreement would be allowed to expire as of midnight Wednesday unless China granted last-minute approval. ___ Barbie maker Mattel to cut more than 2,200 jobs NEW YORK (AP) — Mattel says it will cut 2,200 jobs as the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars seeks to save money.

1406,"DETROIT (AP) — Ride-hailing company Lyft is joining with large Canadian auto parts supplier Magna to develop self-driving vehicles, sharing expenses on a multi-year project that could vault them onto the leader board in autonomous technology. The companies announced the partnership Wednesday and also said that Magna would invest $200 million in Lyft. Raj Kapoor, Lyft's chief strategy officer, says Lyft needs auto industry expertise to manufacture autonomous vehicle components and eventually build the vehicles. Automakers know how to design vehicles so they meet safety regulations and can be manufactured easily, Kapoor said. ""The auto industry has perfected all of these tools and all of those processes,"" he said. Once technology is developed, Magna would be free to sell it to other companies, which would be encouraged to place their vehicles onto Lyft's ride-sharing network, Kapoor said. The tie-up is a huge step forward for both companies, Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid says. Before the announcement, he was skeptical of Lyft's autonomous vehicle efforts because it had no manufacturing ability and very limited data to offer from its ride-hailing network. Magna, he said, knows how to build sensors and assemble engine control computers. ""They know how to do electronics,"" he said. ""They have the capability to design and develop vehicles and manufacture them.""  That can be paired with Lyft's service expertise, Abuelsamid added. The partnership pushes the companies into a group of leaders in the autonomous vehicle race, Abuelsamid says. Also in the race are Google's Waymo, General Motors' Cruise Automation, automotive tech company Aptiv, Renault-Nissan, and a Daimler AG and Bosch partnership, he said. Magna International Inc., based near Toronto, has about 168,000 employees worldwide. It also builds cars under contract in Austria for Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. By next year, Magna expects its factory in Graz to be able to build over 200,000 vehicles per year.",1604,1617,Auto Brand,316
1412,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. auto industry's historic growth streak has ended, but demand for new vehicles — especially SUVs — remains healthy as the new year begins. U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million in 2017, according to Autodata Corp. It was their first year-over-year decline since 2009, ending an unprecedented seven-year expansion. General Motors, Toyota and Ford all reported a 1 percent declines in sales last year compared to 2016. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 8 percent. Honda's sales were flat, while Nissan's rose 2 percent. Volkswagen brand sales rose 5 percent. While sales fell short of 2016's record of 17.55 million, 2017 was still the fourth-best sales year in U.S. history, after 2000, 2015 and 2016, according to Kelley Blue Book. ""It's still a buoyant industry and the underlying factors that drive it are still very positive,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales chief. Analysts think sales will fall a bit further this year. While low unemployment and rising consumer confidence are expected to boost demand, rising interest rates could make it more expensive for people to finance new vehicles. ""That's real money to consumers,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist with Cox Automotive, which owns AutoTrader.com and other car-buying sites. Vehicles also are becoming more durable so consumers can keep them longer, further putting a drag on sales. The average age of vehicles on the road has climbed to 11.6 years, up from 8.8 years in 1998. The growing popularity of leasing will also have a big impact on 2018 sales. Almost one-third of new vehicle sales were leases in 2015, and many of those 4 million lessees will be trading in their vehicles for new ones, according to the car buying site Edmunds.com. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) But leasing also has a downside for automakers, since the influx of late-model used cars returning to the market will cut into sales of new vehicles. Tax cuts also could be a mixed blessing. They will likely stimulate demand, particularly for commercial trucks and vans. But the more the economy grows, the more likely it is that the government will raise interest rates, Chesbrough said. Here are more details of December and 2017 sales: —WINNERS AND LOSERS: Ford's F-Series pickup truck remained the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. in 2017, a title it has now held for 36 years. Ford sold 896,764 F-Series trucks in the U.S. last year, or nearly two trucks every minute, partly because of post-hurricane demand in Texas and Florida. Low gas prices and other factors had buyers ditching cars for SUVs at a fast clip; sales of the Nissan Rogue SUV jumped 22 percent to more than 400,000. But car-heavy brands like Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat all saw their sales drop by double-digit percentages. Toyota Prius hybrid sales plummeted 20.5 percent. — LUXURY CROWN: Mercedes-Benz's sales fell 1 percent to 337,246, but that was still enough to make it the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. for the second straight year. BMW eked out a second-place finish just ahead of Lexus. But some luxury brands struggled. Cadillac and Lexus both saw their sales drop 8 percent last year; Lincoln sales plummeted 17 percent in December. LaNeve said mainstream brands are getting so luxurious that many buyers don't feel the need to step up to a luxury label. — PILING ON THE DEALS: New vehicle prices hit a record last year, averaging $36,113 as buyers bought bigger SUVs and added more safety and infotainment features, Kelley Blue Book said. At the same time, automakers piled on deals in order to juice sales and hang on to their market share. Automakers spent an average of $4,302 per vehicle in incentives last month, passing the previous record set in November, according to the consulting firm J.D. Power. Chevrolet was offering $11,000 off a 2017 Silverado pickup last month. Analysts expect a pullback in incentive spending this year as automakers cut inventory. But there will still be good deals, especially on slow-selling vehicles like midsize sedans. — DECEMBER DIP: No one was expecting U.S. auto sales to top December 2016, which was the best single month in 15 years. Sales dropped 5 percent to 1.6 million last month. Ford's sales were up 1 percent in December as its new large SUVs hit the market, and Hyundai's sales rose 2 percent. But most other automakers saw declines. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 11 percent , while Toyota's sales dropped 8 percent and Nissan's sales were down 9.5 percent. GM's sales fell 3 percent. Volkswagen's dropped 19 percent.",346,359,Auto Brand,317

1420,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Having started a trade war with China and enraged U.S. allies with steel tariffs, President Donald Trump is primed for his next fight. He is targeting a product at the heart of the American experience: cars. Trump's latest plan is to consider slapping tariffs on imported autos and auto parts — a move he says would aid American workers but that could inflate car prices, make U.S. manufacturers less competitive and draw retaliation from other nations. The action has also begun to provoke a backlash among member of Congress, who have so far been reluctant to challenge Trump policies that are upending decades of U.S. policies. On Thursday, manufacturers, suppliers, car dealers and foreign diplomats will line up to testify at a Washington hearing to try to head off auto tariffs. After the hearing, the Commerce Department will decide whether to label imported vehicles and auto parts a threat to America's national security and whether to recommend tariffs to the president. In announcing the auto investigation in May, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said, ""There is evidence that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry."" Yet even General Motors, which ostensibly would benefit from a tax on its foreign competition, is opposed to Trump's plan. And even considering the administration's trade war with China over Beijing's predatory practices in high-tech industries and even after imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from America's closest allies, Trump's auto tariffs raise the ante substantially: The U.S. last year imported $192 billion in vehicles and $143 billion in auto parts — figures that dwarf the $29 billion in steel and $23 billion in aluminum imports and the $34 billion in Chinese goods the administration has so far hit with tariffs. ""This is really taking it up one gigantic notch,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist who studies trade. ""I do think it may be a bridge too far."" In the Senate, Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama and Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have announced plans to introduce legislation opposing Trump's proposed 25 percent auto tariffs. Both warned that the tariffs threaten tens of thousands of jobs in their states. ""Foreign automobiles and auto parts are not a threat to our national security,"" Jones said. ""But you know what is a threat? A 25 percent tax on the price of these imported goods."" Nor is America's auto industry itself crying for help against foreign competition. U.S auto sales reached 17.2 million last year — the fourth-best haul on record. Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, U.S. automakers and parts suppliers have added 343,000 jobs. Despite Trump's threat, the auto trade war might not happen anytime soon, if at all. The president might be angling to use the tariffs to pressure the European Union to lower its own auto tariffs or prod Mexico to agree to a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement more favorable to the United States. ""I'm hoping it's just bluster,"" said Paul Ritchie, owner of Honda and Kia dealerships in Maryland and Pennsylvania. ""I understand where the administration is coming from. Our trade imbalances should be corrected. I'm not sure you can take 25-30 years of neglect on trade imbalances and try to fix it in six months."" Even if the auto tariffs aren't just a negotiating ploy, it could take time before they kick in: It took 10 months for the steel and aluminum tariffs — also justified on national security grounds — to go from proposal to reality. In targeting steel, aluminum and perhaps autos, the administration has weaponized an obscure provision of trade policy: The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 empowers a president to impose unlimited tariffs on particular imports if the Commerce Department finds that those imports threaten national security. The administration has defined national security broadly, suggesting that anything that hurts U.S. economic competitiveness damages national security — ""an argument you can apply to any industry you want,"" noted Philip Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former White House trade adviser. Automakers, in the meantime, have warned that tariffs would raise their costs — and their customers'. In comments filed with the government, GM warned that that ""increased import tariffs could lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less —not more — U.S. jobs."" Even companies that build cars in America rely on imported parts that would be subject to the tariffs, thereby raising automakers' costs. ""There is no automaker that has 100 percent exclusively U.S.-sourced parts,"" said Brian Krinock, Toyota's senior vice president for North American factories. ""It is a global business with global operations."" Toyota manufactures nine models in the United States, all of which use some imported parts. About 30 percent of the Camry's parts are imported, Krinock said, and a 25 percent tariff on those parts would raise the cost of a Camry by $1,800. The Toyota Sienna, made in Princeton, Indiana, would be nearly $3,000 more expensive, he said, and the Tundra pickup truck, made in San Antonio, Texas, would cost $2,800 more. Car collectors, too, have written to Commerce to express their opposition to the tariffs. ""I have been a lifelong car enthusiast, and old cars pose no threat to national security. Neither do their parts,"" wrote Mark Gillett of Dallas, urging Commerce to exempt cars and parts ""of a certain age."" Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimated that the tariffs would raise auto prices overall by 9 percent to as high as 21 percent for luxury models. They would cut the industry's output 1.5 percent and cost 195,000 jobs, a Peterson analysis found. Then there's the threat of retaliation from U.S. trading partners. Toyota exports eight U.S.-made models to 31 countries; those exports could be hit by retaliatory tariffs, Krinock said. Nearly 98 percent of the cars and trucks that would be hit by the tariffs are imported from U.S. allies: The European Union, Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea. If all those countries retaliated by slapping their 25 percent duties on U.S. car exports, it would deepen the impact on the U.S. economy and cost up to 1.2 million jobs in the United States, Posen estimated. The Commerce Department originally set two days of hearings about the proposed auto tariffs, but then cut that to one day. Posen said that cutting back on the time for industry representatives to testify suggests the administration already expects to impose the tariffs. ""This is something where they predetermined the outcome,"" he said. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit.

1442,"BEIJING (AP) — A state-owned Chinese automaker announced plans Wednesday to produce electric vehicles in South Africa, highlighting the growing role of the world's largest auto market in a technology seen as the global industry's future. BAIC Group's announcement at the Beijing auto show, the industry's biggest sales event of the year, came as Nissan unveiled its first electric car designed for China while General Motors displayed Buick SUV it says can go 600 kilometers (375 miles) on one charge. Chinese automaker Geely debuted a gasoline-electric hybrid developed with its Swedish sister company, Volvo Cars. Electrics are money-losers for most producers, but automakers are investing heavily in what they see as the wave of the future, especially in China. Its communist leaders want to make their country a center for the emerging industry and are promoting electrics with subsidies and other tools. China accounted for half of last year's global sales of electrics. Auto executives say Chinese sales of electrics and hybrids could top 1 million vehicles this year. BAIC is preparing to set up a ""new energy car production base"" in South Africa by the end of June, said chairman Xu Heyi. Xu said it would have an annual production capacity of 100,000 vehicles but he gave no details of how much of the manufacturing would be done in South Africa. That would make BAIC the second Chinese company to produce electric vehicles abroad, following BYD Auto, which manufactures battery-powered buses in a California factory. ""BAIC is going to become a leading domestic and world-class new energy car-manufacturing company,"" Xu said. BAIC makes a popular low-priced line of plug-in electrics. It plans to increase total annual sales of electrified models to 1.5 million by 2025, Xu told reporters. The government is shifting the financial burden for developing e-vehicles to automakers with quotas that take effect next year. They require them to earn credits by selling electrics or buy them from competitors. That is forcing brands to create models that can appeal to Chinese buyers without subsidies. At the auto show's media day, Nissan Motor Co. unveiled its Sylphy Zero Emission, the first of 20 electric models the Japanese automaker and its local partner plan to roll out in China over the next five years. Nissan says the Sylphy, a lower-priced version of its popular Leaf, can go 338 kilometers (210 miles) on a charge. ""The new EV era for Nissan begins today,"" said Jose Munoz, chairman of Nissan's management committee for China. Munoz said the car is part of efforts to make China a ""profit pillar"" for Nissan along with Japan and North America. The Beijing show, Auto China 2018, is being overshadowed by mounting trade tensions between Beijing and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods including automobiles in a dispute over technology policy. The impact on automakers should be small, according to industry analysts, because exports amount to only a few thousand vehicles a year. Those include a GM SUV, the Envision, and Volvo Cars sedans made in China for export to the United States. China's first-quarter sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 154 percent over a year earlier to 143,000 units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That compares with sales of just under 200,000 for all of last year in the United States, the No. 2 market. GM, Ford Motor Co., Daimler AG's Mercedes unit and other automakers are developing models for China with local partners that deliver more range at lower prices. On Tuesday, Volkswagen unveiled the E20X, an SUV that is the first model for SOL, an electric brand launched by the German automaker with a Chinese partner. The E20X, promising a 300-kilometer (185-mile) range on one charge, is aimed at lower Chinese market tiers where demand is strongest. ""The Chinese market is key for the international auto industry and it is key to our success,"" said VW CEO Herbert Diess. The auto show follows Beijing's announcement last month that it would allow full foreign ownership in its auto industry beginning with electrics producers this year and extending to all vehicle types by 2020. That would repeal rules that required global automakers to work through local partners, an arrangement that required them to share technology with potential Chinese competitors and prompted complaints by Washington, Europe and Japan. Auto companies have complained joint ventures are costly and cumbersome, but executives said they are unlikely to make any changes immediately. They said automakers are likely to stick with local partners that help with government relations and sales in China's state-dominated economy. ""Relationships and working together is more important in China than any place I've ever worked,"" said Trevor Worthington, Ford Motor Co.'s vice president for Asia-Pacific product development. ""I couldn't imagine a world in which we said we are going to go it on our own."" Electrics are forecast to account for 35 to over 50 percent of automakers' China sales by 2025. At the show, global and Chinese brands also displayed dozens of gasoline-powered models from compact sedans to luxurious SUVs. Their popularity is paying for development of electrics, which aren't expected to become profitable for most producers until sometime in the next decade. China's total sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans reached 24.7 million units last year, compared with 17.2 million for the United States. SUVs are the industry's cash cow. First-quarter sales rose 11.3 percent over a year earlier to 2.6 million, or almost 45 percent of total auto sales, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. New but fast-growing Chinese automakers trail global rivals in traditional gasoline technology but industry analysts say the top Chinese brands are catching up in electrics, a market with no entrenched leaders. BYD Auto, the biggest global electric brand by number sold, presented two hybrid SUVs and an electric concept car at the show. The company, which exports battery-powered taxis to Europe, also displayed nine other hybrid and plug-in electric models. Geely unveiled a gasoline-electric hybrid sedan, the Bo Rui GE, developed with Volvo Cars, also owned by Geely's parent company. Jianghuai Automobile Co., the local partner in VW's Chinese electric brand, also is looking at possible plans to export electric cars to Europe and Latin America, according to Xia Shunli, general manager of JAC's electrics unit. The Geely parent became Daimler's biggest shareholder this year with the purchase of a 9.7 percent stake. Industry analysts say that gives Geely founder Li Shufu leverage to press for possible collaboration, though the German automaker already has a venture with Chinese rival BAIC Group. Daimler had a preliminary meeting with Geely but has yet to discuss alliances or any other details, said its chairman, Dieter Zetsche. He said the meeting was no more than ""get to know each other."" ""We have not even found specific topics to talk about,"" Zetsche told reporters. ""We are in very early stages."" ___ AP researcher Yu Bing contributed.",410,423,Auto Brand,321

1465,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. said Thursday it will begin selling its first self-driving vehicles by 2021 in partnership with U.S. based self-driving technology startup Aurora Innovation Inc. Within in three years, Hyundai and Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to markets that can operate without human input in most conditions, the company said in a statement. The auto industry designates that as ""level 4 autonomous driving,"" just one stage short of fully autonomous driving. The partnership has yet to say how its first batch of self-driving vehicles will be used, but analysts expect they likely be for commercial use, such as self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services, rather than for sales to individual consumers. General Motors said in November that its self-driving vehicles will carry passengers and deliver goods in big cities by 2019. Aurora was founded by a former chief technology officer at Google's self-driving car unit, a former Tesla Autopilot director and a former self-driving engineer at Uber. Hyundai has been pursuing partnerships to keep pace with changes in an industry that is being transformed by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and other cutting edge-technologies. It earlier joined with Cisco Systems Inc. and Baidu Inc. to collaborate on internet-connected cars. It has also set up a $45 million fund with South Korea's SK Telecom and Hanwha Asset Management to invest in artificial intelligence startups worldwide. The South Korean automaker plans to share more details of its project with Aurora during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, where it will also unveil the brand name of a new fuel-cell SUV that will be tested for self-driving technology.

1516,"DETROIT (AP) — In the world of full-size pickups, it's a race to see who can haul more stuff, yet do it with lighter, more efficient trucks. General Motors is taking a big step that way with an all-new Chevrolet Silverado unveiled Saturday night ahead of Detroit's big auto show. The Silverado is the second-best selling vehicle in the U.S. and is outsold only by Ford's F-Series pickups. Big pickup truck sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. One in every seven vehicles sold last year was a full-size pickup. GM says its new truck is up to 450 pounds lighter than the current model. The new Silverado, which goes on sale this fall, slims down by using GM's expertise in melding different metals. Parts that swing, including doors, the hood and the tailgate, are lighter aluminum, but stationery parts such as the bed, are still steel. GM has used the steel bed in marketing, claiming that it's more durable than rival Ford's bed made of aluminum. The Silverado's frame weighs 88 pounds less because it's made of lighter yet stronger high-strength steel, GM says. Aluminum parts in the suspension and other areas make up the rest of the weight loss. The new truck is just under 2 inches longer than the old one for more space in the cargo bed and a roomier interior. Alan Batey, GM's head of North America, said Chevy will offer eight different configurations of the truck from basic work models to well-equipped off-road and luxury versions so they can be personalized. ""People see it as their truck, not the truck that everybody has,"" he said. It also gets two new V-8 engines — 5.3-liters and 6.2-liters — that can shut off any number of cylinders to save gas, yet have ""instant power"" available when needed. There's also a new 3-liter six-cylinder diesel and a 10-speed automatic transmission available. GM wouldn't say if any other engines would be offered, including a V6 gas engine that's now available. Designers and engineers paid particular attention to aerodynamics for better fuel economy, GM said. The sides of a mean-looking front grille direct air around the front wheel wells to reduce wind drag, and there's a spoiler at the back of the cab roof to steer air over the bed. The company wouldn't release the weight or estimated fuel economy, but said the 450-pound weight loss is on a crew cab model with a V8 engine. The current crew cab with a 6.2-Liter V8 gets 15 mpg in the city and 20 on the highway. The truck also has 21 fixed and moveable tie-down points to secure cargo, and a power tailgate is available.

1540,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details of the agreement signed Tuesday were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. ""The tariffs may have accelerated their plans for sure, but longer term they need a presence in the largest auto market globally,"" said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne. Tesla has discussed opening a factory in China since at least 2016. ""Still need to see how it gets paid for, which has been a concern,"" Osborne added. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production. ___ AP Business Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.",791,804,Auto Brand,326
1555,"TOKYO (AP) — Tatsuro Toyoda, the former Toyota Motor Corp. president who led the company's climb to become one of the world's top automakers, has died. He was 88. Toyoda, a son of the company's founder, died Dec. 30 of pneumonia, the Japanese automaker said Saturday. Toyoda, the automaker's seventh president, stepped down from the position in 1995, while continuing in other posts, such as adviser, a title he held until his death. He was instrumental in setting up the California joint venture with U.S. rival General Motors called NUMMI, or New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., which began production in 1984. At that time, it was heralded as a pioneer in international collaborations in the industry. With a career focused on international operations, Toyoda served as NUMMI's first president, and is known for his efforts to bring together Toyota's corporate culture of super-efficiency, teamwork and empowering workers with American culture, including introducing a new style of labor-management relations. Toyoda's father, Kiichiro Toyoda, founded the company. His brother Shoichiro Toyoda, whom he succeeded as president, is current President Akio Toyoda's father. When Tatsuro Toyoda handed the helm to an executive outside the Toyota family, there was speculation he may be the last Toyoda family member to lead the company. But Akio defied skeptics to become president in 2009, underlining the family's legacy for the automaker. The rural house that marks the automaker's humble beginnings serves as a monument today. Toyota employees still repeat the sayings handed down by the family leaders about hard work and a hands-on approach. The company name is spelled and pronounced with a ""T,"" instead of the ""D'' as in the family name, because it was considered to bring luck, according to fortune-telling. Born in 1929, Tatsuro Toyoda was a graduate of the prestigious University of Tokyo, earning a degree in mechanical engineering. In 1953, he joined Toyota, which now makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, and rivals Volkswagen AG, General Motors and the Renault-Nissan alliance as a top automaker in annual global vehicle sales. Toyoda earned an MBA in 1958 from New York University, where he studied under quality-control expert W. Edwards Deming, an American credited with influencing Japanese manufacturing and helping develop its reputation for quality. A memorial service with family members was held for Toyoda, but a bigger farewell is being planned, according to the automaker. He is survived by his wife, Ayako Toyoda, but details on other family members were not immediately available. ____ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at Her work can be found at",513,526,Auto Brand,327
1568,"DETROIT (AP) — Every workday, about 7,400 trucks mostly loaded with automotive parts rumble across the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit and Canada, at times snarling traffic along the busy corridor. But if President Donald Trump delivers on threats to slap 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles and components, there will be far fewer big rigs heading to factories that are now humming close to capacity on both sides of the border. The tariff threat could be a negotiating ploy to restart stalled talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. But it also could be real, since the administration already has imposed duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, as well as steel and aluminum from China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Tariffs against China include some autos and parts but if those spread to Canada and Mexico, the impact will be far larger because auto manufacturing has been integrated between the three countries for nearly a quarter century. The Commerce Department said in a statement last week that it ""has just launched its investigation into whether imports of auto and auto parts threaten to impair the national security. That investigation, which has only just begun, will inform recommendations to the president for action or inaction."" If the wider auto tariffs are imposed, industry experts say they will disrupt a decades-old symbiotic parts supply chain, raise vehicle prices, cut new-vehicle sales, cost jobs in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and even slow related sectors of the economy. ""It seems like it is going to be so devastating that I can't imagine that they're actually going to do it,"" said Kristen Dziczek, vice president of labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. Trump, who was sniping on Twitter at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after a contentious economic summit of the Group of Seven earlier this month, told the Commerce Department to look at national security reasons to justify tariffs with hopes of bringing factory jobs to the U.S. He tweeted that the administration would ""look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!"" But experts predict the tariffs likely would do the opposite, slowing the economy as other countries retaliate. Here's what they say is likely to happen: AUTO PRICES RISE, SALES FALL The tariffs would be charged on parts and assembled autos. Canada, Mexico and others would likely retaliate with duties, and automakers won't be able to absorb all of the increases. So they will have to raise prices. Imported parts, which all cars and trucks have, will cost more, further raising costs. ""We're all going to pay a lot more for vehicles,"" said Tim Galbraith, sales manager of Cavalier tool and manufacturing in Windsor, Ontario, near Detroit, maker of steel molds used to produce plastic auto parts. About 44 percent of the 17.2 million new vehicles sold last year in the U.S. were imported from other countries, and half of those came from Canada and Mexico. All have parts from outside the U.S., sometimes as much as 40 percent. Based on the 24-year-old NAFTA, automakers and suppliers constantly ship fully assembled vehicles as well as engines, transmissions and thousands of small widgets across both U.S. borders. Parts also come from China and other countries. It's difficult to determine how large any price increases would be. But some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that a Chevrolet Equinox small SUV made in Canada would cost about $5,250 more in the U.S. if General Motors doesn't eat part of it. That's based on an average price of $30,000 in the U.S. for the hot-selling Equinox, made primarily in Ingersoll, Ontario. Tariffs are charged on the manufacturing cost, which is about 70 percent of the sales price. Toyota's RAV4, a main Equinox competitor and the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that's not a pickup truck, also is made in Canada and would face the same duties. ""An import tariff would hurt consumers the most since it would increase the costs of vehicles and parts,"" Toyota said in a statement. Honda's CR-V, another small SUV, is made in Ohio and would be exempt from the tariff on assembled vehicles, so it would have a price advantage. But about one-quarter of its parts come from other countries. That would force Honda to raise its price too, said Dziczek. With higher prices, many people will either keep current vehicles or buy used ones. Jeff Schuster, senior vice president LMC Automotive, expects U.S. new-vehicle sales would fall 1 million to 2 million per year if tariffs are imposed. Since U.S. auto factories making popular models are running near capacity, automakers couldn't do much in the short run to build more vehicles in the U.S. and avoid the tariff, Schuster said. JOBS LOST As sales fall, auto and parts makers would need to cut costs by laying off workers. Mexico and Canada would be hit first, but since they import parts from the U.S., component makers domestically also would have to cut. For instance, the RAV4's engines are made in Alabama and transmissions in West Virginia. If sales drop, those factories wouldn't need as many workers. On the assembly line at the Ontario Equinox factory, the 2,400 workers are worried about the escalating dispute, said Joe Graves, the union president. ""I don't really see how one individual can change everything that was put in place over decades,"" Graves said of Trump. ""It does cause a lot of uncertainty and instability with our members."" As sales slump, dealers who sell imported cars would lay off workers, too. The pro-free trade Peterson Institute predicted that if other countries impose tariffs, U.S. auto production would fall 4 percent, costing 624,000 U.S. jobs in about one-to-three years. Other sectors of the economy would also be hit because autos touch nearly all manufacturing, said Dan Ujczo, a trade lawyer in Columbus, Ohio. Tariffs would ""be a shock wave through the economy. And that will be a red line for Congress to step in and do something,"" he predicted. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries would likely hit U.S. agriculture and other businesses, curtailing exports and also costing jobs, said Dziczek. Companies with price advantages due to the tariffs may increase U.S. production, and that could bring more jobs. But Schuster and others expect they would raise production with the existing workforce. Although Trump would like to see auto and parts production relocated to the U.S., experts say such moves are not likely. It would take several years and billions of dollars to plan and build new plants, which companies would be reluctant to do without knowing the tariffs are permanent. It's possible the next president could undo the tariffs, and the industry likely would wait for that, Dziczek said. ____ Frank Bajak in Boston and Chris Rugaber and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",3534,3547,Auto Brand,328

1572,"BEIJING (AP) — President Xi Jinping set the stage Tuesday for a possible effort to resolve a worsening clash with Washington over technology and trade by promising to cut auto import taxes, improve intellectual property protection and boost imports. Xi's pledges at a business conference came as China filed a World Trade Organization challenge over one aspect of its sprawling conflict with President Donald Trump — last month's U.S. tariff hike on steel and aluminum. Strains over U.S. complaints that China is flooding global markets with unfairly low-priced goods and pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology have spiraled into the biggest trade conflict since World War II. Speaking to Chinese and foreign businesspeople, Xi didn't mention Trump or their dispute. He pledged progress on areas that are U.S. priorities including opening China's banking industry but gave no direct response to Trump's demands such as ending requirements for foreign companies to work through joint ventures that require them to give technology to potential Chinese competitors. Private sector analysts saw Xi's speech as an overture to help resolve the standoff that has fueled fears the global economy may suffer a setback if other governments raise their own import barriers. Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods worth $50 billion. Beijing fired back with its own $50 billion list of U.S. goods for possible retaliation. In his speech, Xi tried to position China as a defender of free trade, despite its status as the most-closed major economy, in response to Trump's ""America first"" calls for import restrictions and trade deals that are more favorable to the United States. The speech was free of the nationalist bluster that increasingly marks Chinese official statements and repeatedly called for international cooperation. ""China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open wider,"" said Xi at the Boao Forum for Asia. Xi, the country's most dominant leader since at least the 1980s, said Beijing will ""significantly lower"" tariffs on auto imports this year and ease restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry ""as soon as possible."" He also promised to encourage ""normal technological exchange"" and to ""protect the lawful ownership rights of foreign enterprises."" ""President Xi's speech could create a very good platform to launch U.S.-China dialogue at the WTO to find a deal on intellectual property rights,"" said economist Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit in a report. ""This would be a victory for the world trading system and an important step away from the abyss of rising global protectionism."" The dispute is likely to end ""with a concession from China,"" said Larry Hu of Macquarie Group in a report. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also speaking in Boao, welcomed Xi's promises. ""We look forward to seeing these strategies elaborated, implemented and bearing fruit,"" Lee said, according to a transcript issued by his office. Meanwhile, Chinese diplomats filed a request at WTO headquarters in Geneva for consultations with Washington over Trump's tariff hike on steel and aluminum. If that fails, Beijing can ask for a ruling from a WTO panel of experts. China also has issued a $3 billion list of U.S. goods including pork and apples for possible retaliation. Chinese officials deny foreign companies are compelled to hand over technology, but business groups say joint venture and licensing rules make that unavoidable. Last month, the United States filed a WTO complaint accusing Beijing of violating its trade pledges by imposing unfair contract terms and allowing companies to use foreign-owned technology after licensing periods expire. Foreign companies complain Beijing is squeezing them out of promising parts of the state-dominated economy to promote the ruling Communist Party's plans to create Chinese global competitors in fields including robotics, electric cars and pharmaceuticals. Xi gave no details on how those conditions might change, leaving it unclear whether that might mollify Washington. Easing rules that limit the foreign stake in an auto joint venture to 50 percent might help to address Trump's complaints about technology as well as giving them more flexibility in their biggest global market. Jake Parker, the vice president for China of the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group, welcomed Xi's announcement but expressed hope for additional steps such as ending requirements for joint ventures and technology licensing. ""Ultimately, U.S. industry will be looking for implementation of long-stalled economic reforms, but actions to date have greatly undermined the optimism of the U.S. business community,"" said Parker in an email. Xi repeated earlier official pledges to open China's finance industries to foreign investors but gave no additional details. The biggest beneficiaries of a cut in China's 25 percent tariff on most auto imports will be the handful of automakers such as electric car brand Tesla that have no factory in China. Other automakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen that assemble vehicles in China with local state-owned partners could offer additional models. More broadly, Xi repeated official promises to expand imports and to narrow China's trade surplus, which reached $423 billion last year — about two-thirds of that with the United States. ""China does not seek a trade surplus,"" said Xi in comments that were broadcast on national television. ""We have a genuine desire to increase imports and achieve a greater balance of international payments."" The bulk of Xi's 40-minute speech was devoted to China's vision for economic development and its global role following a ruling party congress in October that installed him for a second five-year term as leader. Xi tried to defuse concern about Beijing's growing military might and territorial disputes with its neighbors, saying his government wants to pursue peaceful, cooperative development. ""We will not bully our neighbors,"" the president said. ""Cold war thinking and zero-sum games are increasingly obsolete.""",5067,5080,Auto Brand,329

FEDERAL RESERVE-POWELL Fed chair signals gradual rate hikes in tame inflation era WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the Fed will likely keep raising short-term interest rates at a gradual pace, partly because there are few signs, so far, that the ultra-low U.S. unemployment rate is pushing up inflation. In a speech in Portugal, Powell said Wednesday that with the unemployment rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent and inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target, the case for continued gradual increases in rates ""is strong."" Low unemployment historically has pushed up inflation as companies raise prices so they can pay more to keep workers. But Powell noted that the sharp drop in unemployment since the recession has occurred ""without much apparent reaction from inflation."" That suggests the Fed is less likely to accelerate rate hikes pre-emptively to forestall inflation. Powell's remarks at a central banking forum come just a week after the Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate for the second time this year. Fed policymakers signaled they will likely hike rates twice more this year. EUROPE-US TARIFFS EU says it will start to impose tariffs on US on Friday BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union will start imposing duties on a list of U.S. products as of Friday in response to President Donald Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe.

VOLVO-NEW VEHICLE Volvo watches tariffs as 1st US plant opens RIDGEVILLE, S.C. (AP) — Volvo is showing off its first car to be made-in-America, even as the economic climate changes radically under President Donald Trump. Volvo Cars officially opened its South Carolina plant Wednesday with a glitzy ceremony that revealed the Swedish automaker's redesigned S60 hybrid-powered sedan, which will roll off the assembly line this fall. But the auto market has changed considerably since Volvo announced in 2015 it would build its first U.S. plant in Ridgeville. President Donald Trump was elected in 2016 and is threatening tariffs that could impact foreign carmakers. Volvo executives say they want to end all tariffs between the U.S. and Europe and China, where Volvo's owners are based. The executives say they are watching Trump carefully to react if his decisions affect their company. NEW CAR QUALITY Automakers improve quality to record level in annual survey DETROIT (AP) — A survey of new-vehicle buyers finds that car and truck quality hit a record high this year as automakers started to clear up bugs with infotainment systems. The annual survey by J.D. Power finds that buyers reported a record-low 93 problems per 100 vehicles during the first three months of ownership, four problems fewer than last year. The survey also found that Korean brands Genesis, Kia and Hyundai claimed the top three spots for the first time in new vehicle quality. Porsche and Ford rounded out the top five. J.D. Power also found that the Detroit three improved their quality faster than the industry as a whole. Fiat Chrysler knocked off seven problems, while Ford and General Motors each dropped five. The lowest-ranking brands were Land Rover, Jaguar and Volvo. SKOREA-HYUNDAI MOTOR-AUDI Hyundai Motor, Audi join hands for fuel cell technology SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group says it has signed an agreement with Audi AG to jointly develop electronics vehicles powered by fuel cell. Under the multi-year agreement signed Wednesday, Hyundai's affiliates including Kia and Audi's parent company Volkswagen AG will share components, supply chains and patent licensing. The duration of the partnership wasn't disclosed. Hyundai, the world's fifth-largest automaker, began to mass produce fuel cell vehicles in 2013. But in South Korea and elsewhere, wider adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles has been slow largely due to a dearth of refueling stations. South Korea's government plans to add more hydrogen refueling stations to increase electronics vehicle sales and reduce carbon emissions. BATTLE FOR FOX Disney ups Twenty-First Century Fox to more than $71B NEW YORK (AP) — Disney is offering more than $71 billion for Fox's entertainment businesses in a counterbid to Comcast's nearly $66 billion offer. The battle for Twenty-First Century Fox reflects a new imperative among entertainment and telecommunications firms. They are amassing ever more programming to better compete with technology companies such as Amazon and Netflix for viewers' attention — and dollars. The deal would include Fox film and TV studios, some cable networks and international assets, but not Fox News Channel or the Fox television network. AT&T just bought Time Warner for $81 billion, after a federal judge rejected the government's antitrust concerns. Disney offered more than $52 billion in December, at $28 per Fox share. It's now offering $38. Comcast's bid was for $35.

1653,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is getting rid of three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next 3½ years. The company says it's sinking $175 million into a Lansing, Michigan, factory to make replacements for the ATS compact, CTS midsize and XTS full-size cars. Automakers are starting to dump sedan models in the U.S. as buyers continue to flock to SUVs and trucks. Fiat Chrysler cut U.S.-made compact and midsize cars in 2016, while Ford announced earlier this year that it would stop selling all cars but the Mustang over the next several years. This year trucks and SUVs accounted for more than two thirds of U.S. auto sales, with cars at about one third. Just five years ago it was about half for each. The ATS won't be replaced but Cadillac hopes to cover its market with the new vehicles. The ATS was designed to compete with the BMW 3 Series but never really caught on. The XTS was based on a Chevrolet Impala but also never sold well. It also overlapped with Cadillac's CT6 flagship large sedan. Last year ATS sales fell 39 percent, while CTS sales dropped 35 percent and XTS sales were off 27 percent. The ATS recovered a bit this year but is still far behind competitors. Spokesman Donny Nordlicht would say only that the new cars will debut by the end of 2021, and that further details would be released later. The changes will not change the Lansing Grand River factory's workforce of about 2,000 people. The Cadillac brand is emphasizing SUVs to match market demand, according to GM. Cadillac has promised to put out seven new vehicles by the end of 2021, with only two of them being sedans.",15,28,Auto Brand,337

1667,"WHAT'S HAPPENING European companies that export from China are changing the global flow of their goods to avoid paying higher American tariffs. Tariff hikes are hurting companies that rely on a free flow of trade, said Mats Harborn of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. So companies are scrambling to adjust their supply chains to keep U.S.-bound goods from passing through China. The Trump administration's tariff hike on medical equipment, electronics and other goods from China apply to exports made by U.S. or European companies as well as by Chinese suppliers. At the same time, BMW Group and the biggest Chinese SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, have announced a partnership to produce electric MINI vehicles in China. It's a sign that global automakers are increasing development under pressure from Beijing. BMW and Great Wall said their venture will also make electrics for the Chinese partner's brand. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology. ___ WHAT'S NEXT President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. is ready to target an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports — and then $300 billion more — if Beijing refuses to yield to U.S. demands and continues to retaliate. If his administration went ahead with that threat, it would raise the total of targeted Chinese goods to potentially $550 billion — more than the $506 billion that China actually shipped to the United States last year. Even if the Trump administration doesn't follow through on that threat, more individuals could be affected over time by the tariffs that kicked in last week. Some American companies that rely on Chinese-made machinery or parts, for example, will eventually have to pass along at least some of their higher costs to customers. Others will likely decide to hold back on hiring. ___ THE BACKDROP Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of goods in response to complaints that Beijing is hurting American companies by stealing or pressuring enterprises to hand over technology. The U.S. trade war with China is the most consequential trade conflict the Trump administration has provoked. But it's hardly the only one. It has also applied tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The 28-country EU bloc has responded with import taxes on $3.25 billion of U.S. goods. In the meantime, the Trump administration has threatened to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump has also spoken about slapping tariffs on imported cars, trucks and auto parts, which General Motors has warned could hurt the U.S. auto industry and drive up car prices.",2648,2661,Auto Brand,338
1684,"HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese passenger car sales expanded at a faster pace last month as growth in the world's biggest auto market picked up steam, an industry group said Friday. Monthly figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers show that passenger cars sales in April rose 11 percent over a year earlier to 1.9 million vehicles, outpacing a 3.5 percent growth rate in March. Sales of ""new-energy vehicles"" such as electric cars and gasoline-electric hybrids more than doubled to 82,000. China's communist leaders view electric vehicles as key to transforming China into a technological superpower. Global automakers including General Motors, Nissan and Volkswagen unveiled dozens of electric and hybrid vehicles at the Beijing auto show last month. Recent moves by Beijing to loosen up restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry gave priority to the electric vehicle industry. Under the new rules, requirements for foreign car brands to team up with local state-owned partners will be scrapped by 2022, while limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers will be eliminated this year. The relaxed regulations came amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China that might dent U.S. auto imports — Ford vehicles are facing longer waits as Chinese customs agents tighten up inspections. The company said its China sales fell 26 percent in April to 69,503 vehicles. China's total vehicle sales including trucks and buses rose 11.5 percent to 2.3 million. The latest numbers are an improvement on uneven sales earlier this year and a lackluster performance last year as sales growth cooled following a surge in 2016 that was driven by tax cuts.

BUSINESS: EPA-PESTICIDES WASHINGTON — Federal scientists have determined that a family of widely used pesticides poses a threat to dozens of endangered and threatened species, including Pacific salmon, Atlantic sturgeon and Puget Sound orcas. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued its new biological opinion on three organophosphate pesticides — chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion — after a yearslong court fight by environmental groups. At the urging of pesticide manufacturers, the Trump administration had sought a two-year delay of a court-ordered deadline to issue the findings by the end of 2017, but it was unsuccessful.

1712,"BURTON, Mich. (AP) — A groundbreaking has been held by General Motors Customer Care and Aftersales for a $65 million automotive parts processing center near Flint. Detroit-based GM says Wednesday that the ACDelco and Genuine GM Parts warehousing and logistics facility will be on 141 acres (57 hectares) in Burton. It is expected to open early next year. It will have 1.1 million square feet (102,193 square meters) of floor space and 84 shipping and receiving docks. About 700 workers will staff the facility. GM says the parts are used to maintain Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles sold in the U.S. and hundreds of competitor vehicles.

1729,"DETROIT (AP) — The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opened to the press this week with one big question hanging in the air: How will autonomous vehicles change the industry? The answer is still unclear. In the meantime, automakers continue to put out new vehicles of all shapes and sizes, including small cars, SUVs and the all-mighty pickup truck, which dominated the show. All will be on display when the show opens to the public Saturday, with a charity preview on Friday night. Here are five things we learned from the preview this week: TRUCKS ARE KING Pickups are the most popular vehicles in the U.S., and trucks unveiled at the show make clear that will continue for a long time. General Motors spent heavily to update its top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup, cutting up to 450 pounds of weight by using more aluminum and lighter high-strength steel. The truck also gets two new V8 engines that can run on one to eight cylinders depending on how much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler's Ram also got big updates, losing more than 200 pounds and giving it a gas-electric hybrid engine option. Both the Silverado and Ram were given more athletic stances and meaner looks. Ford added a diesel engine to its F-150 and rolled out the midsize Ranger. Automakers turn big profits on large pickups. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. Ford's F-Series is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the Silverado and Ram. TAX REFORM BOOST? U.S. auto sales are likely to fall to around 16.7 million in 2018 from 17.2 million last year, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. But that would still make it one of the 10 best sales years in history, so the market remains strong. U.S. income tax code changes this year may stimulate new auto sales, but any increase likely will be offset by rising interest rates and the abundant supply of late-model used cars that pull buyers from new vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp.'s top North American executive says. North American CEO Jim Lentz expects a sales boost of 200,000 vehicles as tax cuts put more money in people's pockets. But the increase could be negated as rising rates keep some people on the sidelines, and some buyers opt for a lower-cost but nice off-lease used car. Tax cuts could boost pickup truck sales because businesses can write off the expenses immediately under the new code, Lentz said. But he expects luxury new-car sales to be flat this year even though tax rates were reduced for higher-income earners. Any decrease could be wiped out by caps on deductions for mortgage interest and local and state taxes in big luxury-car states such as New York and California, Lentz said. TRADE DEAL Many auto executives interviewed at the auto show say they're afraid the U.S. might pull out of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, but they can't prepare for it because they don't know what, if anything will replace it. In ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada, the Trump administration is seeking to ensure that more vehicles are made in America, among other changes. But Jim Lentz, Toyota's North American CEO, says ending the agreement would likely raise costs. That, in turn, would raise vehicle prices and cut demand, forcing manufacturing layoffs. It also would make the U.S. less competitive than the world's other manufacturing centers, he said. Ending the agreement also could force some suppliers to stop making parts. Charlie Chesbrough, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, said it's hard to imagine there will be much change in production, because automakers need a long lead time to act and they know the next president could reverse Trump's actions. But some automakers are already taking pre-emptive steps to show the administration they're willing to boost U.S. production. Fiat Chrysler said ahead of the auto show that it will move heavy duty truck production from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. HEDGING ON ROBOT CARS Automakers are hedging their bets when it comes to autonomous vehicles and whether they will someday cut into or even end personal car ownership. In interviews through the week, executives said they're preparing for a time when people hire self-driving ride services to get around instead of spending on personal vehicles. But they don't know just when that will take place, so they also must continue to spend millions to develop conventional vehicles as well. ""These proclamations that we hear about the advent of electrification and artificial intelligence ... are all things that, at best, are conjecture,"" said Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Although some companies plan to deploy driverless cars to carry passengers in coming months, Marchionne says it will take years for the vehicles to be in widespread use. Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development says he wishes he knew exactly when and where the switch would take place. But for now, GM and other companies have to be in both places. ""We can go either way and that agility is priceless,"" said Reuss. GOOD OLD DAYS Despite the new wheels on the show floor, one of the biggest hits is a 50-year-old Mustang GT fastback in need of a paint job. It was one of the original cars used in the 1968 film ""Bullitt,"" which put the Mustang on the map with a famous chase scene. Ford Motor Co. rolled it out to help celebrate a special ""Bullitt"" edition Mustang, which goes on sale this summer. The faded green car got a huge cheer when it rumbled onto the stage.",705,718,Auto Brand,292

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released today fell two points to 68 in June. That's down from a reading of 70 in May that snapped a four-month slide in builder confidence. Any reading above 50 indicates more builders see sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has remained above 60 since September 2016. Builders' view of current sales conditions fell one point, to 75 this month. The outlook for sales over the next six months fell one point to 76. A measure of buyer traffic fell one point to 50. MILLIONAIRE TAX Group in support of tax disappointed by ruling BOSTON (AP) — A citizens group that collected more than 150,000 signatures in support of a so-called ""millionaire tax"" in Massachusetts says it is ""incredibly disappointed"" that the state's high court has blocked the measure from going before voters in November. The Raise Up Coalition faulted a ""few wealthy corporate executives and their lobbyists"" for bringing the lawsuit against the proposed constitutional amendment. The Supreme Judicial Court, in a 5-2 decision, ruled today that the measure should not have been certified by the attorney general because it contained unrelated items of taxing and spending. The proposal called for a surtax of 4 percent on annual income exceeding $1 million, with the revenue going for transportation and education. The business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation applauded the ruling, calling it a ""great day for all Massachusetts taxpayers.""

CADILLAC-PLANT INVESTMENT GM replaces 3 Cadillac sedans with 2, invests $175M in plant DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is getting rid of three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next 3½ years. The company says it's sinking $175 million into a Lansing, Michigan, factory to make replacements for the ATS compact, CTS midsize and XTS full-size cars. The ATS won't be replaced but Cadillac hopes to cover its market with the new vehicles. The ATS was designed to compete with the BMW 3 Series but never really caught on. The XTS was based on a Chevrolet Impala but also never sold well. It also overlapped with Cadillac's CT6 flagship large sedan. GM would say only that the new cars will debut by the end of 2021. It would not give further details. The changes will not increase the factory's workforce. SUPREME COURT-iphone APPS Supreme Court to take up iPhone app lawsuit WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will consider whether the purchasers of iPhone apps can sue Apple over allegations it has an illegal monopoly on the sale of the apps. The court said Monday that it will take a case from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled in January that the purchasers of iPhone apps could sue Apple. Their lawsuit says that when a customer buys an app the price includes a 30 percent markup that goes to Apple. Apple had argued that it did not sell apps, but instead acted as an intermediary used by the app developers. Apple won initially in a lower court which dismissed the lawsuit.

The Plain Dealer reports overtime for registered nurses in the prison system has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2012. Payroll records show some prison hospital nurses have earned over $100,000 in overtime in one year. The state presently has about 480 registered nurses working in prisons and about 50 job vacancies. Ohio has relied on volunteer overtime to fill the staffing gaps. Union leaders say they've urged administrators to hire more nurses, but retention remains an issue.

Promoting the constitutional protections for states' rights — outlined in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — has always been popular among politicians. But it also is situational.

23,"GENEVA (AP) — At the Geneva motor show, some automakers want visitors to focus their minds more on the models — the cars, that is, not the women. In the wake of the #MeToo movement's explosion and growing awareness about sexual harassment, some auto executives have been taking a new look at the traditional use of often scantily-clad women on display stands at auto shows. Some companies say a cultural shift is in the air. Though a walk through this year's Geneva auto show suggests the industry still actively associates its products with female sensuality and uses models to leverage that. ""I don't think we will be able to change the situation from one day to the next,"" said Susie Wolff, former development driver for the Williams racing team in Formula One, which has recently decided to stop using models at the start of competitions. Wolff doesn't like the idea of women standing by merely to be objectified. ""But I think we are making change in a positive way,"" said Wolff, who was at the show to promote an initiative to get more women involved in motorsports. Leggy and heavily made-up models still adorn the stands at the Geneva show, though there seems to be a bit less skin on show than previous years. ""We never looked into optics, or whatever, when it comes to our presenters,"" said Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes. ""Our customers coming here expect from us that we can properly explain what our product is all about. And that is for me the more important thing."" Johan van Zyl, the head of Toyota Motor Europe, said his company isn't using women models to shape the image of the vehicles. ""It is all about explaining the product,"" van Zyl said. ""Of course, models can also be utilized, but we don't want to make a derogatory type of display of females. It is not our company value and it is not what we want to be: Totally against it."" Neither Toyota nor Rolls-Royce had models standing by the cars, though they did have assistants — both women and men — dressed in business-wear to provide information to visitors. Silvia Blattner, a spokeswoman for the Palexpo convention center that hosts the auto show, declined to wade in on the issue, saying in an e-mail that the motor show is a ""neutral"" platform for carmakers, which are free to decide how to present themselves. Still, change comes hard — and not all companies are on board. The Skoda display for its Vision X featured a visit from the 2011 Miss Czech, Jitka Novackova, posing for cameras in a short dress and black leather boots rising over the knee. Automakers like Alfa Romeo and Ssangyong, among others, trotted out models, too. ""If I'm honest, I can sense very little difference in the way the car companies are using the women on their stands. There are still women draped on cars as we walk around the show,"" said Jim Holder, editorial director of Autocar. ""Really, is that acceptable in the modern world as a way to present your company?"" ___ Jamey Keaten contributed to this report.",1516,1521,Auto Brand,344
24,"OCALA, Fla. (AP) — In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is blind, climbed into the driver's seat of a self-driving car and rolled up to the drive-thru of a Taco Bell in a video that's been viewed more than 8 million times online. The piece, produced by Google, captured the potential of autonomous-car technology to change the lives of the visually impaired. ""It was my first time behind the steering wheel in seven years and was absolutely amazing,"" Mahan said. Self-driving-car advocates say that in addition to helping the disabled, the vehicles will allow people to do other tasks while driving and  make roadways safer by removing human error. But six years after Google's viral video, national advocates for the estimated 1.3 million legally blind people in the U.S. are worried the industry is not factoring their needs into the design of the new technology, a mistake they say will make the cars more expensive and harder for them to access. ""Although we have been held up as obvious beneficiaries of the technology in conversations and presentations, this will have just been exploitation if the systems are not accessible,"" said Anil Lewis, executive director of the National Federation of the Blind's Jernigan Institute. ""How about instead of Taco Bell, we demonstrate a blind person independently operating an autonomous vehicle, dropping off his/her kids at school on the way to work, and maybe stopping by a Starbucks on the way?"" The concerns are fueling new research outside the auto industry to develop data and software meant to help ensure the needs of the blind are met when autonomous cars become commonplace. In a University of Florida study, blind people are using experimental software that could be easily installed in cars and peoples' phones. On a recent sunny winter day in central Florida, Sharon Van Etten eased into the backseat of an SUV and began speaking to a computer screen in front of her. ""Where do you want to go?"" the computer's voice responded. Van Etten, who is legally blind, said ""Kmart,"" and off the car sped, the computer's voice intoning, ""Central Christian Church on the left"" and other landmarks as they coasted down the street. When the driver pulled the car up to the store, the voice told Van Etten which side to exit from and mentioned some of the obstacles she'd face between the car and the store entrance. University of Florida researcher Julian Brinkley developed the program, which he has named ""Atlas."" Using data he collects from users like Van Etten and others through collaboration with the Florida Center for the Blind in Ocala, he's figuring out the specific needs blind people have using self-driving cars, and using his software to solve problems. ""If I'm a visually impaired person and I don't have the ability to verify visually that I'm at the appropriate location, how do I know that it's not dropping me off in a field somewhere?"" Brinkley said. ""In the case of autonomous cars, hopefully accessibility will be moved to the forefront by some of the research."" Brinkley doesn't have access to a self-driving vehicle so instead uses a process developed by Stanford University researchers in a specially configured conventional vehicle. Participants interact with vehicle-control software in what appears to be a self-driving vehicle, and the vehicle's driver, hidden behind a partition, uses instructions from the software to drive to the right place. Participants don't know that a human driver is at the controls. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory also are working on accessibility issues for driverless vehicles for blind and other people with disabilities. At Waymo, Google's self-driving-car company that started nearly a decade ago, officials say visually impaired employees contribute to design and research. While no specific system for blind riders has been completed, the company says it's developing a mobile app, Braille labels and audio cues. Spokespeople for General Motors Cruise AV group, Nissan North America Inc. and Toyota Research Institute all said the companies are committed to accessibility in general but offered no further comment. Mahan, the man famous for the YouTube video who still consults with Waymo, said he's cautiously optimistic. ""Autonomous vehicles aren't being designed for blind people; we're one of the beneficiaries of the technology,"" the 65-year-old said from his San Jose, California, home. ""They're working on it. I don't push. They expose me to what they're working on, and so I'm patiently waiting."" Autonomous-car industry analysts say the needs of disabled people are being discussed as designers figure out how users will interface with the cars, but there are many competing demands. ""They're trying to figure out what way to interface with these vehicles for riders, and to build a sense of trust about what the vehicles are doing,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Navigant Research in Detroit. ""But right now, I don't know if anyone has all the answers."" In the meantime, advocates for the blind have turned to Florida's Brinkley and other researchers to push development forward. Back in Ocala, Cinzhasha Farmer giggled nervously as the Atlas voice spoke to her. The 41-year-old was eager to participate in Brinkley's study so she can one day drive without relying on others. ""It's one of my goals, and I don't know how I'll ever accomplish it — but that car may do it,"" she said with a smile. ___ Associated Press writer Tamara Lush contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jason Dearen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen",4076,4081,Auto Brand,345

Under the settlement, lawsuits will be resolved through a trust fund. Takata was forced into bankruptcy amid lawsuits, multimillion-dollar fines and crushing recall costs involving the air bags. Key to the restructuring plan is the planned sale of most of its assets to a Chinese-owned rival for $1.6 billion. Takata's air bag inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 16 people have died and more than 180 have been injured due to the problem, which has touched off the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history. At least 42 million vehicles and as many as 69 million inflators have been recalled in the U.S. More than 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. Thirteen automakers have joined the agreement, including General Motors and Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. The manufacturers, which are both Takata's largest customers and biggest creditors, are indemnified in their agreements with Takata from losses and liabilities related to the air bag inflators. Takata will file an amended version of the reorganization plan in court, according to the documents. A spokesman for Takata said the company had no comment on the settlement.",1415,1420,Auto Brand,347

The suit was filed Wednesday in federal court. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality says while the Michigan-based company has been cooperative, a judge should still order Wolverine to prevent endangerment to public health and take other steps.

SOUTH BEND-ABORTION CLINIC SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The Indiana State Department of Health has rejected an abortion provider's application to open a clinic in South Bend, citing ""inaccuracies"" in its paperwork and failing to meet a requirement that it has ""reputable and responsible character."" A Texas-based nonprofit, Whole Woman's Health Alliance, applied for the license last August. It sought to open a non-surgical clinic that would offer abortion medication that women would take in the presence of a physician. Indiana legislators in recent years have passed laws making it more difficult for clinics to perform abortions. A longtime clinic in South Bend closed after the state revoked Dr. Ulrich Klopfer's license in 2015. Another clinic in Gary closed that same year.

124,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful even within the traditional confines of a State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump inflated the impact of his tax cuts Tuesday night, declared an end to a ""war"" on energy that did not exist when he took office and displayed a faulty grasp of immigration policy. A look at some of the statements in his speech and how they compare with the facts: TRUMP: ""We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history."" THE FACTS: No truer now than in the countless other times he has said the same. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ TRUMP: ""After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" THE FACTS: Actually, they are not rising any faster than they have before. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in 2017, slightly slower than the 2.9 percent increase recorded in 2016 under President Barack Obama. Most economists say that wages should increase at a faster rate as the unemployment rate drops. The unemployment rate stands at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that has done little so far to spark rising wages. The last time unemployment was this low, in the late 1990s, average hourly pay was rising at a 4 percent pace. ____ TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: That's a highly misleading characterization. The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Barack Obama's, making accusations of a war on energy hard to sustain. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that: The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the last decade. ___ TRUMP: ""We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money."" THE FACTS: Few economists think average incomes will jump by $4,000 simply because companies are paying less in taxes. The figure cited by Trump comes from his chief economist, Kevin Hassett. Many mainstream economists poked wide holes into this claim, including the author of one of the research papers cited by Hassett. Economists generally say most of the savings from lower corporate taxes would flow to investors, rather than workers. The problem with the $4,000 claim is that Trump is essentially promising $500 billion in income gains across the entire economy from tax cuts that are a small fraction of that total on an annual basis. ___ TRUMP: ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker."" THE FACTS: This appears to be true, but may not be as impressive as it sounds. According to a tally of public announcements by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that supported the tax law, about 3 million workers have gotten bonuses, raises or larger payments to their retirement accounts since the tax law was signed. That's about 2 percent of the more than 154 million Americans with jobs. The Labor Department said before the tax package was signed into law that 38 percent of workers would probably get some form of bonus in 2017. Few companies have yet granted across-the-board pay raises, which Trump and GOP leaders promised would result from the cut in corporate tax rates included in the overhaul. Many, such as Walmart and BB&T Bank, said they will raise their minimum wages. Walmart made similar announcements in 2015 and 2016. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. It's a far cry from what Trump and the GOP-led Congress set out to do last year, which was to scrap most of the sweeping Obama-era health law and replace it with a Republican alternative. The GOP blueprint would have left millions more Americans uninsured, making it even more unpopular than ""Obamacare.""

127,"TOKYO (AP) — Technology companies are racing to develop ultra-precise digital maps that can guide self-driving cars within inches of where they should be — a hurdle the industry needs to clear if it hopes to deliver on its promise of widespread use of driverless vehicles. Japan's government is backing a three-dimensional developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. that includes a wealth of details such as trees and pedestrians. It promises to be off by no more than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches). That would be a big improvement over satellite-based GPS, which is used by ships, aircraft and increasingly by drivers or on mobile phones but can be off by up to 20 meters (65 feet), especially inside buildings or underground. The developers say the improved mapping technology likely will be used first in vehicles in isolated areas such as warehouses, or it might be used to help drivers of vehicles that aren't entirely autonomous. Its challenges and dangers were highlighted in March when a self-driving Uber SUV being tested on a street in suburban Phoenix struck and killed pedestrian in the industry's first fatality. Autonomous, or even semi-autonomous, driving will require sensors, radars, cameras and computer software to handle acceleration, braking, steering normally done by human drivers. That requires precise and accurate information about not just road lanes but repairs, traffic lights, crosswalks and buildings. That is relayed to moving vehicles, which requires additional telecommunications connections. On a computer screen, such maps are masses of tiny points swimming around in virtual 3D, defining a landscape of trees, roads, signs, buildings, cars and pedestrians. Data are collected by special vehicles carrying sensors and cameras. Those have drivers for now, but at some point autonomous vehicles are expected to take over. ""For autonomous driving, 3D high-precision maps will be very important, allowing cars to know their positions accurately and also know what the roads are like ahead,"" said Yasuhide Shibata, senior general manager of Mitsubishi Electric. Starting in November, Japan will also get positioning information from its government satellites, including three launched last year, called QZS, Quasi-Zenith Satellite System. Japan wants driverless cars on the roads by 2020, with hopes the Tokyo Olympics will showcase its technological prowess the way the 1964 Tokyo Summer Games displayed its new bullet train to the world. But mapping services are popping up everywhere. Even Japanese automakers are also wooing mapping services other than the national brand. Among the global players: —TomTom, based in Amsterdam. It is working with Japanese map maker Zenrin Co. —DeepMap, in Palo Alto, California, co-founded by James Wu, who worked for Google Maps and Apple Maps. Wu is promising 5-centimeter (2-inch) precision. Among Japanese automakers, it is working with Honda Motor Co. —HERE, co-owned by German automakers and Intel Corp. It signed a partnership late last year with Japanese electronics and car-navigation maker Pioneer Corp. with hopes of growing in Japan. Three months ago, Toyota Motor Corp. hired Mandali Khalesi from HERE to lead its automated-driving initiative. Digital 3D maps focus on highways, where landmarks are easier to discern and define. Khalesi thinks Toyota can gain an edge by developing technology for city streets and off-road rural areas. He hopes to use satellite imagery. ""To be honest, there is a lot of catching up for us to do. We should be open about that,"" Khalesi said on Toyota's digital mapping. He said Toyota should partner with existing mapping services, and not try to ""reinvent the wheel,"" but innovate where the technology was lacking. ""There is money to be made definitely,"" he said. Japan's government-backed initiative is led by the electronics unit of the sprawling Mitsubishi group of companies, which also includes satellites, robotics and an automaker. Japanese automakers including Honda, Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. are also investors in Dynamic Map Platform Co., the outfit created to make commercial applications out of the technology. ""Everybody's got a different angle on it, a different idea,"" said Christopher Richter, auto analyst for CLSA Securities Japan Co. ""These are things we've never needed before and so everybody's got a fresh idea, and everybody is looking for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" said Richter. ""There's going to be quite a few pots of gold."" ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at Her work can be found at",3127,3132,Auto Brand,351
129,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump struck a variety of false notes in his big speech to Congress this past week and followed up with a curious coda — a plain-as-your-face exaggeration about the TV audience that tuned in for it. A look at some of Trump's recent statements, from his State of the Union address and beyond: TRUMP: ""Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history."" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Not the highest in history. Trump's TV viewership as measured by Nielsen (45.6 million, as he said) trailed that for first State of the Union speeches by Barack Obama (48 million), George W. Bush (51.7 million) and Bill Clinton (46.8 million). Trump also got more TV viewers in his first speech to Congress a year ago (47.7 million) than in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. There is no reliable measure for how many people watched Tuesday on their computers or phones, a slice of viewership that is not counted by Nielsen. But Trump was not factoring in those viewers in his false claim. He cited the Nielsen number only. ___ TRUMP: ""We've signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."" — remarks Thursday to Republican lawmakers' retreat. THE FACTS: No. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more.

THE FACTS: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in speeches this past week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ""and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members."" On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ""our partners in Central America."" That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. ___ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on beautiful clean coal."" THE FACTS: Coal is not clean. According to the Energy Department, more than 83 percent of all major air pollutants — sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, toxic mercury and dangerous soot particles — from power plants are from coal, even though coal makes up only 43 percent of the power generation. Power plants are the No. 1 source of those pollutants. Coal produces nearly twice as much heat-trapping carbon dioxide per energy created as natural gas, the department says. In 2011, coal burning emitted more than 6 million tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides versus 430,000 tons from other energy sources combined. ___ Associated Press writers Hope Yen, Josh Boak, Matthew Daly, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Eric Tucker, Seth Borenstein and Elliot Spagat contributed to this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck EDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures",5112,5117,Auto Brand,352

143,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German automaker Volkswagen had record sales of 10.74 million vehicles last year, but its bid to remain the world's largest carmaker was disputed by rival Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. Volkswagen's sales rose 4.3 percent from 10.30 million in 2016, when the company passed Japan's Toyota to become the globe's largest auto producer for that year. The figures show the Wolfsburg-based company continuing its effort to move past a scandal that broke in September 2015 over cars it had rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests. Sales last year were boosted by a strong December, when sales rose 8.5 percent. For the year, the company saw big jumps in Russia and Brazil, and significant gains in China and the United States.

Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ TRUMP: ""After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" THE FACTS: Actually, they are not rising any faster than they have before. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in 2017, slightly slower than the 2.9 percent increase recorded in 2016 under President Barack Obama. Most economists say that wages should increase at a faster rate as the unemployment rate drops. The unemployment rate stands at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that has done little so far to spark rising wages. The last time unemployment was this low, in the late 1990s, average hourly pay was rising at a 4 percent pace. ____ TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: That's a highly misleading characterization. The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Barack Obama's, making accusations of a war on energy hard to sustain. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that: The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the last decade. ___ TRUMP: ""We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money."" THE FACTS: Few economists think average incomes will jump by $4,000 simply because companies are paying less in taxes. The figure cited by Trump comes from his chief economist, Kevin Hassett. Many mainstream economists poked wide holes into this claim, including the author of one of the research papers cited by Hassett. Economists generally say most of the savings from lower corporate taxes would flow to investors, rather than workers. The problem with the $4,000 claim is that Trump is essentially promising $500 billion in income gains across the entire economy from tax cuts that are a small fraction of that total on an annual basis. ___ TRUMP: ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker."" THE FACTS: This appears to be true, but may not be as impressive as it sounds. According to a tally of public announcements by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that supported the tax law, about 3 million workers have gotten bonuses, raises or larger payments to their retirement accounts since the tax law was signed. That's about 2 percent of the more than 154 million Americans with jobs. The Labor Department said before the tax package was signed into law that 38 percent of workers would probably get some form of bonus in 2017. Few companies have yet granted across-the-board pay raises, which Trump and GOP leaders promised would result from the cut in corporate tax rates included in the overhaul. Many, such as Walmart and BB&T Bank, said they will raise their minimum wages. Walmart made similar announcements in 2015 and 2016. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. It's a far cry from what Trump and the GOP-led Congress set out to do last year, which was to scrap most of the sweeping Obama-era health law and replace it with a Republican alternative. The GOP blueprint would have left millions more Americans uninsured, making it even more unpopular than ""Obamacare."" Other major parts of the overhaul remain in place, including its Medicaid expan",6919,6924,Auto Brand,350
155,"DETROIT (AP) — A car that once was America's top-seller is about to die — for a second time. Ford Taurus, may you rest in peace at the salvage yard. Blame the full-size sedan's slow demise on the national obsession with SUVs and Ford Motor Co.'s need to slash costs and remake itself for a new era of self-driving cars and shuttles. Ford announced the car's passing this week as part of major restructuring plan aimed at focusing capital spending on more popular SUVs and technology needed to morph Ford into a mobility company. The 114-year-old automaker said it would stop selling all car models in North America but two: the Mustang muscle car and a version of the compact Focus called Active. That means Ford's Chicago plant will stop making Tauruses next March. North American production of the Focus compact car and Fiesta subcompact will halt in May, while the midsize Fusion lives a few more years before it departs. They'll be replaced by five new SUVs, all to deal with a market that has shifted dramatically in five years. Last month, trucks and SUVs were two-thirds of U.S. new vehicle sales. They were less than half in March of 2013. ""We will focus on products and markets where we know we can win,"" new CEO Jim Hackett said in making the announcement. That means the end of the line for the Taurus, which was completely remade as a new car for a third time in the 2010 model year. The timing couldn't have been worse. It came out as high gas prices were sending families to more efficient midsize sedans like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Then the SUV boom hit. ""It had everything going against it,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher for Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader. The Taurus was built on heavy, older underpinnings, limiting Ford's ability to create more interior space or make the car more efficient, Brauer said. At the same time, midsize competitors used newer technology for better ride and handling and to expand inside space. As a result, sales of the latest Taurus peaked in 2013 at nearly 80,000, falling to just over 41,000 last year. The latest Taurus did develop a bit of a cult following, though, especially the 365-horsepower turbocharged performance version called S.H.O. for ""Super High Output."" ""It's really a sad thing to see a good car like that go,"" mused Corey Aaron of Buford, Georgia, who owns a metallic gray 2013 S.H.O. that he loves because it can out-accelerate many other cars yet looks like a sleepy family sedan. Aaron, a member of an S.H.O. enthusiast club, says Ford is short-sighted for getting rid of a car with a loyal following. Before the Taurus, Aaron bought only foreign-brand vehicles, which he considered to have better performance and quality. ""After getting behind the wheel, it totally changed my perspective on domestic manufacturers,"" he said. The Taurus debuted in late 1985 at a time when Ford was in financial trouble and needed a big hit. The company had found that American tastes were changing away from big, boxy sedans to more nimble and efficient European cars. So more than 1,000 Ford staffers came up with a sleek-looking, roomy car with a smooth ride that was efficient and handled like a smaller car. Derisively called a ""flying potato"" by a competitor, the Taurus was so futuristic that it became the template for all modern sedans. By the 1990s, the cars were everywhere. The Taurus became the best-selling car in America in 1992 with sales of nearly 410,000, just as Japanese imports were starting to take hold. It kept the top spot for five years until being supplanted by the Toyota Camry in 1997. Sales remained strong until the Taurus got a makeover in 1996. Although the second generation sold well, it never matched the original car's numbers. In the late 1990s, Ford began focusing more on higher-profit trucks and SUVs and let the Taurus languish. The last one rolled off the assembly line in 2006. By then, Ford had sold over 7 million of them, many going to rental car companies toward the end. Shortly after production stopped, Ford again was caught off-guard by spiking gas prices and had little to offer consumers. It got into financial trouble again before a new CEO came in. He realized the value of the Taurus brand, resurrected the name and relabeled what was then the Five Hundred sedan. Don't be surprised if the Taurus name rises from the ashes again because it is well-recognized by consumers, said Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys Inc., a New York customer research firm. It could even be repurposed on a new SUV, but that vehicle will have to fill unmet needs for consumers, Passikoff said. ""It's always easier to create a new product with an old name than it is to create a new product with a new name,"" he said. ""The foundation for history, the foundation for engagement is already there."" Ford won't give up rights to the Taurus name, which it still uses in China on a different car, spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said. Asked if the name will reappear, she said, ""You never know.""",1528,1533,Auto Brand,357

TRUMP-INFRASTRUCTURE-STATES Trump infrastructure plan seeks to shift burden to states JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — A $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan by President Donald Trump could place greater pressure on state and local governments to come up with more of their own money for big projects. Trump said during his State of the Union address that every federal dollar in his plan should be leveraged by private investors or state and local governments. Some state transportation officials said Wednesday that they already struggle to meet the matching requirements for their existing federal transportation dollars. They said a higher matching rate to qualify for Trump's program could require them to raises taxes or fees to generate enough revenue. Trump also has suggested that private entities could help finance public infrastructure projects in exchange for collecting fees from users. Some states don't currently allow that. BNSF INVESTMENTS BNSF to invest $3.3 billion in rail maintenance, upgrades OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — BNSF railroad is planning to invest $3.3 billion in its railroad again this year. The Fort Worth, Texas-based railroad said Wednesday it plans to match last year's spending on maintenance projects and upgrades to its rail network. BNSF plans to spend $2.4 billion to maintain and repair its rail network and locomotives. That will include rehabilitating 13,000 miles of track. The railroad's plans also include investing about $500 million to expand capacity. BNSF says it is nearly done with the installation of the automatic braking system federal officials required. So the railroad plans to spend only about $100 million on that system this year. BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. BNSF operates 32,500 miles of track in 28 western states and three Canadian provinces. FIXING FACEBOOK Facebook's 'fixes'- meaningful or just skin deep? NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made fixing Facebook his personal challenge this year, and the company has already announced several changes to that end. For example, it's showing users more posts from friends and family instead of businesses and publishers. But it's far from clear if these tweaks will produce lasting change, or if they're merely cosmetic adjustments designed to generate goodwill while keeping people glued to Facebook. Critics such as Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist and early Facebook investor, say the recent changes don't address the threats to elections or public health that Facebook needs to address. Zuckerberg says it will take some time — ""months,"" perhaps — for its changes to make their way to users. JAPAN-NINTENDO Mario and Minions?

Japanese video-game company Nintendo Co. says a movie starring the plumber in the Super Mario franchise is in the works, being co-produced with Chris Meledandri, the chief executive of Illumination Entertainment, the U.S. animation studio behind the popular ""Despicable Me"" series. Nintendo's star game designer Shigeru Miyamoto told reporters Thursday the script is mostly finished and is promising a ""fun"" movie, since Meledandri shares his thinking on creative projects. The movie, two years in the making after a meeting between Meledandri and Miyamoto, is set for global distribution through Universal, which co-owns Illumination, according to the Kyoto-based maker of Pokemon games and the popular Switch machine.

Earlier in January, the retailer said it was closing more than 100 locations under the Sears and Kmart names. That includes 64 Kmart stores and 39 Sears stores that will be shuttered between early March and early April. That's in addition to closing about 250 stores announced last year.

219,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking leverage in immigration talks, President Donald Trump overstated the impact of a March 5 deadline after which he suggests a program protecting thousands of young immigrants from deportation would end. In fact, a recent court ruling has rendered that deadline basically meaningless. The president also made a puzzling plain-as-day exaggeration about the size of the TV audience that tuned in for his big speech to Congress last week. It capped another week of Trump statements — many of them made during his State of the Union address — that strained credulity, on immigration, energy, crime, health care and more. A look at some of the questionable claims: TRUMP: ""March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!"" — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: Not so fast. A recent court ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration's plan to end the program has left the March 5 deadline all but moot for now. The deadline dates back to Sept. 5, when Trump announced that he was ending the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provided protection from deportation and work permits for about 800,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. as children and are now living here illegally. To lessen the blow, the administration announced that recipients whose status was set to expire before March 5 would be allowed to apply for renewals, so long as their applications were received within a month. Trump framed that as giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. But that timeline became far less significant when a federal court judge in San Francisco blocked Trump's action, saying young immigrants would suffer ""irreparable harm."" In response, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it was once again accepting DACA renewals, processing them just as they had before Trump's September announcement — including renewals for applicants whose permits expire after March 5. The judge's order to accept DACA renewals will remain in effect at least until the Supreme Court rules definitively. Trump is using the March 5 deadline as pressure for Democrats to come to the table, while Democrats will probably spend the next month arguing that a failure to act leaves DACA recipients vulnerable and living in fear. But without a looming deadline, it seems doubtful there would be the same urgency to get something done. ___ TRUMP: ""Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history."" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Not the highest in history. Trump's TV viewership as measured by Nielsen (45.6 million, as he said) trailed that for first State of the Union speeches by Barack Obama (48 million), George W. Bush (51.7 million) and Bill Clinton (46.8 million). Trump also got more TV viewers in his first speech to Congress a year ago (47.7 million) than in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. There is no reliable measure for how many people watched Tuesday on their computers or phones, a slice of viewership that is not counted by Nielsen. But Trump was not factoring in those viewers in his false claim. He cited the Nielsen number only. ___ TRUMP: ""We've signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."" — remarks Thursday to Republican lawmakers' retreat. THE FACTS: No. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. He made the same claim Tuesday night and countless times before that. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II.

The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa.

245,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales shrank in December and ended 2017 up a lackluster 1.4 percent over a year earlier as the popularity of SUVs helped to offset falling demand for sedans, an industry group reported Friday. Last month's purchases of SUVs, sedans and minivans in the biggest market by number of vehicles sold shrank 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.6 million, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses edged up 0.1 percent to just over 3 million. Weak demand is a setback for global automakers looking to China to drive revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing the industry to pour resources into developing electric vehicles. 2017's annual growth was barely one-tenth the previous year's 15 percent rate, which was boosted by a temporary tax cut. Chinese demand has weakened as economic growth slowed and Beijing and other major cities tightened restrictions on car ownership to curb smog and congestion. SUV sales in December rose 8.4 percent over a year earlier to just under 1.2 million, accounting for 46 percent of the total. Sedan sales shrank 4.3 percent to 1.2 million. For the year, SUV sales raced ahead 13.3 percent to 10.2 million while sedan demand shrank 2.5 percent to 11.8 million. Global auto brands including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. and local brands including Geely and BYD have grown faster than the market, taking share from smaller Chinese rivals. 2017 sales by Chinese brands rose 3 percent to 10.8 million. Their market share expanded by 0.7 percentage points over 2016 to 43.9 percent. Sales of lower-cost, Chinese-brand SUVs, the most popular vehicle segment, surged 18 percent over 2016 to 6.2 million. The industry is the midst of a massive investment campaign to ramp up production of electric vehicles under pressure from Beijing to meet official minimum sales targets that take effect in 2020. VW announced in November it will spend $11.8 billion by 2025 to develop and manufacture all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for China. Ford Motor Co. announced plans last month to roll out at least 15 new electrics in China by 2025.

299,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Donald Trump instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives Friday. The president met with top auto executives to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs. A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months. Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards. The EPA under Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025. The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard. If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. Any big change by Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states. In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard. ""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina. As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily. Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens."" ""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable."" Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales. Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump. Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said. Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars. Auto executives attending the meeting included Marchionne, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett and Bob Carter, executive vice president of North America for Toyota. __ Krisher reported from Detroit. __ On Twitter follow Tom Krisher at http://twitter.com/TKrisher and Ken Thomas at http://twitter.com/KThomasDC",5726,5731,Auto Brand,370
317,"Most car shoppers know that a used car can be a fantastic value. In the long run, a used car will usually cost less than a new one, and it will virtually always be cheaper than leasing a car every three years. As practical as it is to buy a used car, it can also present an opportunity to get a little fancy. This is where ""cousin cars"" come in. Cousin cars are vehicles that are produced by one parent company and offered in two versions: one for the luxury buyers and the other for the masses. But because luxury vehicles tend to depreciate more quickly than everyday cars, the price difference often narrows as the cars age. The upshot is that if you shop for an upscale used cousin car, it is often possible to get it for a price that's close to that of its more mundane relation. Some cousin car pairings include the workaday and the luxurious , the fuel-efficient and the sporty , and the commodious and the fully appointed . Here are a few examples across different car segments. These are based on average transaction prices for the year, make and model discussed. They do not represent any particular trim level: SEDANS: and In 2012, the average transaction price for a new Lincoln MKZ was roughly $37,024. That's about $11,600 more than the average price of its mass-market cousin, the 2012 Ford Fusion, which had an average sale price of $25,427. The average sale price of a used 2012 MKZ is now $12,887 compared to $9,939 for a 2012 Fusion, narrowing the difference to about $2,900. If you opt to buy an MKZ for that extra $2,900, you'll get a plusher cabin, fancier styling, heated and cooled leather seats with memory function, and a long list of other standard features. and If you were considering both the ES 350 and the Camry as new cars six years ago, you would have had to decide if the Lexus, which had an average transaction price of $38,415, was worth paying $14,000 more than the well-equipped but less opulent Camry. The Camry's average sale price was $24,306 in the same time frame. If you shop for them as used cars now, you'll find the ES 350 will have an average sale price of $17,775, only about $5,500 more than the average used car price of a 2012 Camry, which is $12,285. The ES 350 has upgraded features such as smart-key access, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, larger wheels and tires, the option of parking assist, and a quieter, more refined ride quality. MIDSIZE SUV: and The 2013 Lexus GX is a midsize SUV that has all the features you'd expect in a high-end vehicle. But its standard V8 engine, off-road prowess and 6,500-pound towing capability set it apart from luxury crossovers that wouldn't dare to cross a stream. Its utility reflects its kinship to the Toyota 4Runner: They share a fair amount of automotive DNA. In 2013, the GX had an average transaction price of $57,181 compared to $36,704 for the 2013 4Runner, for a $20,477 difference. As used vehicles, the average price for a 2103 GX is about $29,509. A used 2013 4Runner will have an average sale price of $25,245. That difference is only about $4,300. If you pony up the extra money for the GX, you would get a well-appointed interior that includes heated and cooled leather seats, a moonroof and a power-folding third-row seat. The Lexus also has a more premium feel and an upscale exterior to match. LARGE SUV: and A new 2013 Escalade had an average price of $71,747. The average sale price of its cousin, the 2013 GMC Yukon, was $55,041, for a $16,706 difference. Fast-forward to 2018, and the price average price of a used 2013 Escalade is $35,871, compared to $31,346 for a 2013 Yukon, a difference of about $4,500. The extra charge for the Escalade gets you an engine that's larger and more powerful than the engines found in the Yukon line (with the exception of the Yukon Denali). You'll also get a flashier exterior, standard navigation, a Bose stereo system, and a slew of other luxury upgrades. When you're shopping cousin cars, remember that the luxury option could come with additional long-term costs, such as a higher insurance rate and more expensive parts and service. It might also require premium fuel, which can cost up to 50 cents more per gallon. To help you shop, here are the standard car brands and their luxury cousins: — Honda and Acura — Volkswagen and Audi — Ford and Lincoln — Hyundai and Genesis — Nissan and Infiniti — Toyota and Lexus When it comes to General Motors, the vehicle hierarchy isn't always quite as clear. The GM family includes Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. Several vehicles share platforms across the brand names with varying degrees of upgrades. As a rule, Chevrolet is the entry point. Buick and GMC are more upscale. Cadillac is strictly luxury. EDMUNDS SAYS: If you're a savvy shopper, you might be able to get a great deal on a used luxury vehicle for not much more than the price of its more humble cousin. Being practical doesn't mean you can't pamper yourself. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

372,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Japanese automakers Toyota and Mazda on Wednesday announced plans to build a huge $1.6 billion joint-venture plant in Alabama that will eventually employ about 4,000 people. Several states had competed for the coveted project, which will be able to turn out 300,000 vehicles per year and will produce the Toyota Corolla compact car for North America and a new small SUV from Mazda. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and company executives held a joint news conference to announce that the facility is coming to the Huntsville area not far from the Tennessee line. Production is expected to begin by 2021. ""This is indeed a great day in Alabama,"" Ivey said. ""Thank you for believing in the potential of our people in the great state of Alabama. ... Toyota and Mazda, thank you so much. Welcome to sweet home Alabama."" To lure the plant, the state offered an incentive package of $370 million in tax abatements and investment rebates, Alabama Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said. That figure does not include a local incentive package still being finalized. The state will also provide workforce training. Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motors, said the new facility is something of a homecoming since the company already has one plant in the state. The new Huntsville plant will be just 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Alabama, which produces four-cylinder, V-6 and V-8 engines for several Toyota models. The decision to pick Alabama is another example of foreign-based automakers building U.S. factories in the South. To entice manufacturers, Southern states have used a combination of lucrative incentive packages, low-cost labor and a pro-business labor environment since the United Auto Workers union is stronger in Northern states. North Carolina apparently was a finalist in the running for the huge factory but remains one of the few Southeast states not to land a modern carmaker. Alabama was tied with Tennessee as the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in the country last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The state produced 9 percent of the cars made in the U.S., the center said. ""Alabama won a first place trophy today in being selected for that plant,"" said Dave Sullivan, product analysis manager at AutoPacific Inc., an automotive research company. Sullivan said the factory itself is a huge asset for the state, but it will also cause economic ripples by bringing spinoff jobs at suppliers and service companies in the area. U.S. sales of small cars fell nearly 10 percent last year as buyers continued a massive shift toward SUVs and pickup trucks. Corolla sales fell 14 percent for the year, to just less than 309,000, according to Autodata Corp. Still, Toyota and Mazda have said their collaboration will respect mutual independence and equality. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, already provides hybrid technology to Mazda, which makes compact cars for Toyota at its Mexico plant. The sheer cost of the plant also makes a partnership logical, as it boosts cost-efficiency and economies of scale. Working together on green and other auto technology also makes sense as the segment becomes increasingly competitive because of concerns about global warming, the environment and safety. Alabama started on the road to becoming an auto manufacturing hub in 1993 when Mercedes chose it as the location for a manufacturing plant after the state offered a then-eye popping $250 million incentive package. Honda and Toyota followed by putting engine plants in the state. In 2002, Hyundai announced an assembly facility in Montgomery. ____ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed to this story from Detroit, Michigan.",44,49,Auto Brand,376

461,"TOKYO (AP) — Toyota is seeing a nearly doubling of profit for the fiscal third quarter, and it lifted its annual profit projection through March to 2.4 trillion yen ($22 billion), a record high for the Japanese automaker. Toyota Motor Corp. reported Tuesday an October-December profit of 941.8 billion yen ($8.6 billion), up from 486.5 billion yen the same period the previous year. Quarterly sales rose 7.4 percent to 7.6 trillion yen ($69.8 billion). The company said it got a nearly 292 billion yen ($2.7 billion) boost from tax breaks under President Donald Trump's administration for the nine months through December. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, said it expects to sell 10.3 million vehicles globally in this fiscal year, ending in March. That is about the same as what the automaker sold globally in the 2017 calendar year. The fiscal year profit of 2.4 trillion yen, if achieved, will mark a 31 percent jump from what it earned the previous fiscal year. For the latest quarter, Toyota's vehicle sales lagged on-year in North America. But they grew in Japan, Europe and other parts of the world, such as South America and Africa, compared to a year earlier. Recently, Toyota picked as the site for its new U.S. plant Huntsville, Alabama — already a hub for the region's aerospace industry. The plant is set to produce 300,000 vehicles per year, a combination of the Toyota Corolla compact car and a new small crossover SUV from Mazda. Production is targeted to begin by 2021. Many states had competed for the project by the Japanese auto giants. For the calendar 2017 year, Toyota sold 10.386 million vehicles. That trails the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, which brings together a French company with two Japanese automakers, which recorded global vehicle sales of more than 10.6 million vehicles last year.

463,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government's road safety agency is urging automakers to speed up replacement of potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement Friday that Heidi King, it's top official, has met with 19 affected companies urging them to accelerate the recalls and to post recall plans on their websites. The statement didn't say if automakers agreed to the request and NHTSA did not immediately answer messages left Friday. Automakers missed a Dec. 31 deadline to replace 100 percent of the oldest and most dangerous inflators, and they have been slow to complete the recalls, which began more than 15 years ago. Automakers say it's difficult to get people to take their cars in for repairs, especially with older models. Takata's inflators can explode with too much force and hurl shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 23 people have been killed and about 300 injured worldwide. The inflators have resulted in the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, covering 37 million vehicles and about 50 million inflators. ""It's imperative that manufacturers take every available step to reach each and every owner of a vehicle with deadly air bags and take action to ensure that those dangerous air bags are replaced as soon as is safely possible, King said in the statement. But Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said King has placed the burden on consumers rather than using the agency's authority to make automakers comply. ""Today, we see yet again this administration's inability to protect consumers as this announcement does nothing to make more readily available the replacement air bags that tens of millions of Americans are waiting on and deserve,"" he said Friday in an email. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said in an email that he asked King to demand that automakers submit binding plans to show how they'll fix the vehicles. ""She needs to stop begging them for action, and actually use her authority to get the job done,"" he said. Toyota said it already has made Takata recalls more prominent on its website and is publishing quarterly compliance reports that include scheduled recalls. NHTSA is managing the recalls in an effort to make sure the most dangerous inflators are replaced first. Nissan said it already has accelerated one recall because parts are available. A General Motors spokesman was looking into the matter. A Ford spokeswoman said the company has posted recall information on its website but didn't answer a question about accelerating the recalls.

Toyota said it reached a deal with Grab Holdings to strengthen the existing partnership to grow in mobility services in the region. A Toyota executive will be appointed to Grab's board and another Toyota official is being tapped to be an executive officer at Grab, the company said. Grab, which is similar to Uber in the U.S., is in eight nations in the region, including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. Uber's Southeast Asian operations were acquired by Grab earlier this year. Uber retained a 27.5 percent stake in the new merged entity. Toyota was initially cautious about ride-sharing and autonomous-driving technology. In recent years, the maker of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models has been aggressively playing catch-up, signing on partners around the world. Grab, based in Singapore, has recently attracted investments from SoftBank, a Japanese technology and telecommunications company, and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-sharing and autonomous driving company.

492,"One of the most price-effective and time-tested ways to go off the beaten path in a motorized vehicle is to buy a used SUV or pickup and modify it with aftermarket parts to enhance its performance. Well, there's also something to be said for getting a new vehicle straight from the dealer showroom that's ready to play in the dirt. And more than ever before, automakers are offering vehicles with those off-road modifications already installed for you. To showcase this trend, we've rounded up a group of capable off-the-lot off-roaders. Just note that this isn't a comprehensive list of vehicles. Rather, we picked some of our favorites to highlight the varied abilities and price tags that are available and ordered them by truck, SUV and wagon body type. 2018 CHEVROLET COLORADO ZR2 In most of its configurations, the Chevrolet Colorado is your typical midsize truck. It's capable and versatile, but it's far from being a dominant force in the dirt. The ZR2 trim, though, is something else entirely. Thanks to its lifted suspension, knobby tires, locking rear differential and modified bodywork, the ZR2 is a top-tier choice for a go-anywhere vehicle. MSRP: $42,000 2018 FORD F-150 RAPTOR The Ford F-150 Raptor is one of the biggest and heaviest off-roaders on our list, yet it can drive across bumpy deserts at impressively high speeds. If you want to own a from-the-factory truck that best mimics a Baja 1000 race truck, the Raptor is what to get. A sophisticated suspension and powerful turbocharged engine make it both entertaining and proficient off-road. MSRP: $50,155 2018 JEEP WRANGLER RUBICON For decades, the Wrangler has been an off-road enthusiast's gateway to the outdoors. For 2018, it's been completely redesigned. Jeep has added a wide array of welcome comfort and tech updates without diminishing the Wrangler's off-road prowess. The Rubicon trim in particular has a high stance, standard four-wheel drive, big tires, and exclusive traction-enhancing features that make it the king of the hill. MSRP: $37,495 2018 LAND ROVER DISCOVERY SPORT HSE Most small luxury SUVs aren't capable enough to handle much more than an occasional gravel road, but the Discovery Sport is a notable exception. This is Land Rover's least expensive SUV, yet it maintains the brand's reputation for enhanced off-road abilities. The Discovery Sport has a sophisticated traction management system to help it make the most of your recreational adventures. MSRP: $42,395 2018 TOYOTA 4RUNNER TRD PRO Thanks to its traditional body-on-frame SUV design, the 4Runner is pretty good right out of the box. In the TRD Pro trim, though, it's even more adept off-road. On top of the standard 4Runner equipment, the TRD Pro gets items such as a locking differential, Bilstein shock absorbers with rear remote reservoirs and a front skid plate. This SUV should easily get your family just about anywhere it wants to go. MSRP: $42,675 2018 SUBARU CROSSTREK 2.0i Almost all Subarus come with all-wheel drive, which provides enhanced traction in wet weather. For the Impreza-based Crosstrek, though, Subaru goes further by raising the ride height and adding more rugged tires and some upgraded underpinnings. The result isn't an extreme rock-crawler like the Wrangler, but it can still take you farther into nature than any other economy-minded hatchback. MSRP: $21,795 2018 AUDI A4 ALLROAD The Audi A4 Allroad wagon has the lowest limits compared to the other vehicles on our list, but we like it because it has its own set of desirable attributes. A slight suspension lift (compared to a regular A4 sedan), combined with plenty of modern technology and a classy cabin design, make this a capable all-wheel-drive car that you can enjoy both on and off the trail. MSRP: $44,500 EDMUNDS SAYS:  Automakers are increasingly offering vehicles that come optimized for driving in off-road situations straight from the factory.

495,"DETROIT (AP) — Automotive journalists crowned the Honda Accord the North American Car of the Year on Monday, a first for the longtime model that's twice flirted for the top honor as a finalist. The 10th-generation Accord edged out the Kia Stinger and Toyota Camry for the award, which was announced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The award program, now in its 24th year, has twice gone to the Honda Civic. Henio Arcangeli Jr., senior vice president for Honda's auto sales division, said the award represents ""not resting on past ... achievements."" The Accord, which went on sale last fall, is among many revamped car models hoping to snare buyers as sales fall and SUVs rise. Arcangeli calls the Accord ""new from the ground up,"" with more coupe-like styling and its first-ever turbocharged engines. Honda sold 322,655 Accords in the U.S. in 2017, a 6.5 percent decline over the previous year. The Volvo XC60 took the top prize in the utility category and the Lincoln Navigator for trucks. Other utility finalists were the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and Honda Odyssey, and Navigator beat the Chevrolet Colorado and Ford Expedition. Kumar Galhotra, head of the Lincoln brand, said the award should give the Navigator a boost as it tries to gain traction in the competitive full-size truck-based luxury SUV market. ""It is a very competitive segment, and in the past we have had much better share in this segment,"" he said. ""It was time to create a new Navigator and take that rightful place in the segment for Lincoln."" The brand sold only 10,523 Navigators last year, far behind competitors in the segment such as the Cadillac Escalade. The General Motors luxury brand sold 14,700 Escalades last year. Last year's winners were the Chevrolet Bolt, Honda Ridgeline and Chrysler Pacifica minivan. Sixty U.S. and Canadian automotive journalists serve as judges for the awards program, which patterned itself after the European Car of the Year. Eligible vehicles, chosen from dozens, must be new or substantially changed. The choices represent an aim to recognize the vehicles' overall quality: The judges evaluate finalists on value, innovation, design, performance, safety, technology and driver satisfaction.

515,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales growth rebounded in January into positive territory, boosted by strong demand for SUVs, an industry group reported Friday. Sales of sedans, SUVs and minivans rose 10.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.4 million, recovering from December's 0.7 percent contraction, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses rose 13.6 percent to 2.7 million. Sales of SUVs, which make up nearly half of purchases, rose 22.9 percent over January 2017 to just over 1 million. The industry is coming off lackluster 1.4 percent growth last year as the market paid back a 2016 surge following a sales tax cut that boosted purchases by 15 percent. Weak demand is a setback for global automakers looking to China to drive revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing the industry to pour resources into developing electric vehicles. Automakers are forecasting this year's total market growth at 3 to 4 percent, a fraction of earlier double-digit rates. Demand has weakened as economic growth slowed and Beijing and other major cities tightened restrictions on car ownership to curb smog and congestion. Competition is intensifying as global and Chinese automakers pour billions of dollars into ramping up production of electric vehicles under pressure from Beijing to meet official minimum sales targets that take effect in 2020. January sales of electric and hybrid vehicles rose 430 percent, though from last year's low base, to 38,470. ""Despite being in a period of policy uncertainty, the trend of sales of new energy vehicles driven by the market still is relatively strong,"" said the CAAM general secretary, Cui Dongshu, in a statement. ""The development of new energy vehicles still faces many problems,"" said Cui.

But there are plenty of other vehicles at the show, which is one of the industry's largest. Mercedes and BMW have new SUVs, while several Japanese automakers are showing off prototypes of future vehicles. It's all happening in a U.S. auto market that's shrinking but still expected to remain at healthy levels. Last year sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million, still near record highs. Analysts expect sales to be just under 17 million in 2018. Here are some of the vehicles being unveiled at the show, which opens to the general public on Saturday: ACURA RDX PROTOTYPE Honda Motor Co.'s struggling Acura luxury brand hopes to revive sales with a new version of its best-selling RDX. Acura showed a prototype of the midsize SUV at the show, but it's close to the version that will go on sale in mid-2018. The 2019 RDX, which is the first to be designed in the U.S., is longer, lower and wider than the current model, with sharper lines outlined in chrome. A wide, panoramic glass roof will come standard. Under the hood is a new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Acura says the RDX will have the most legroom and cargo space in its class. There's also a touchpad to control infotainment functions on the 10.2-inch dashboard screen. Acura didn't reveal pricing, fuel economy or other details. VOLKSWAGEN JETTA Volkswagen's redesigned Jetta offers more room — and a shot at redemption as the automaker recovers from a 2015 emissions-cheating scandal. The German automaker says the 2019 Jetta is longer, wider and taller than previous models. VW also aims for a sportier look, with a large front grille, higher chrome quotient and LED lighting. The car has a new standard six-speed manual transmission. An eight-speed automatic transmission is optional on the base model. The Jetta's revamped interior includes a new storage console large enough to fit a standard iPad. The car is among the first of two new models planned this year and will come with a six-year, 72,000-mile warranty — double what it has been. It goes on sale in the second quarter at a starting price of $18,545 — less than its predecessor. FORD EDGE Ford Motor Co. is introducing a high-performance version of its midsize Edge SUV this summer: the Edge ST. It has a 2.7-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 engine that puts out 335 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. That's paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive comes standard, and there's a specially tuned sport suspension. The Edge ST also has special design cues, including a wide mesh grille, 21-inch wheels and ""performance blue"" paint. The regular Edge also gets an update, with a more efficient 2.0-liter four-cylinder that puts out 250 horsepower. New safety features include ""evasive steering assist,"" which uses cameras and radar to detect slower-moving vehicles. Pricing on the Edge and Edge ST hasn't yet been released. TOYOTA AVALON Toyota has taken the wraps off its revamped Avalon, which features a longer, lower and wider exterior and a rear cabin that extends another 7 inches (17.8 centimeters). The automaker boasts of a ""neater"" steering wheel, with a smaller switch cluster, enlarged hand grips and cruise control now accessible on the right spoke. The touch screen can be ""pinched"" or ""flicked"" like a smartphone. The new Avalon also can connect with a smart watch or Amazon Alexa-enabled device. The car has two new powertrains: a 3.5-liter V6 and 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid system. The Michigan-designed Avalon will arrive in showrooms in late spring. FORD MUSTANG BULLITT Ford Motor Co. is making a special edition Mustang to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ""Bullitt,"" whose unforgettable car chase scene helped turn the sports car into an icon. The 2019 Mustang Bullitt — due out this summer — will have an upgraded 5.0-liter V8 engine that puts out 475 horsepower. It has a top speed of 163 miles per hour (262 kilometers per hour) and a manual transmission with a white cue-ball shift knob. It's available in dark highland green, the color ""Bullitt"" made famous, as well as black. Molly McQueen — granddaughter of ""Bullitt"" star Steve McQueen — introduced the 2019 Mustang Bullitt on Sunday at the Detroit auto show. It's the first Ford has produced since 2008. Ford didn't reveal the cost. MERCEDES G-CLASS Mercedes' boxy-looking G-Class SUV gets a face-lift that the company says will boost performance both on and off the road. The company readily acknowledges that its appearance hasn't changed much in almost four decades. But the 2019 version gets numerous changes including 2 additional inches (5 additional centimeters) of length and 4.8 inches (12 centimeters) of width. The G-Class gets a new independent front suspension as well as a nine-speed automatic transmission. It's still powered by a 4-liter V8 with 416 horsepower. It also gets new LED headlamps. The G-Class will go on sale in the U.S. by late 2018, but no specific date was announced, nor pricing or fuel mileage. BMW X2 BMW's sporty X2 small SUV will sit between the compact X1 and the bigger X3 in the automaker's lineup. It sits low and has a more muscular body than its siblings. The X2 also has a widened version of BMW's signature double kidney grille. The 228-horsepower xDrive28i, which goes on sale in the U.S. in March, is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It's mated to an eight-speed transmission. The 192-horsepower sDrive28i goes on sale later this spring. Drivers can flip a switch and choose a driving mode, from comfort, eco-friendly or sport. The suspension can also be lowered for more dynamic driving. On the optional M Sport X Package, drivers get gearshift paddles on the steering wheel for quicker shifting.

544,"DETROIT (AP) — An investigation has found that the U.S. government's highway safety agency failed to act quickly on a consumer complaint, and that could have delayed recalls of dangerous Takata air bag inflators. A report by the Transportation Department's Inspector General also found that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration process for monitoring car and truck recalls isn't adequate. And the report released Wednesday says the agency isn't verifying recall completion rates reported by automakers or making sure manufacturers file proper documents. ""Overall, inadequate controls and processes for verifying and collecting manufacturer-reported information have hindered NHTSA's ability to oversee safety recall implementation,"" the inspector general wrote. The safety agency responded with a statement Wednesday saying that it had taken ""unprecedented actions to ensure public safety is prioritized,"" including improvements to search functions on its Takata recall website, and that it continues to improve its processes. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, the ranking Democrat on a committee that oversees NHTSA, said the report is cause for the Senate not to confirm Deputy Administrator Heidi King as NHTSA's leader. ""This is further evidence that the federal auto safety regulator isn't doing enough to protect the public,"" he said in a statement. The report is one of at least three in recent years criticizing the agency for its oversight of recalls. Investigations have discovered NHTSA shortcomings in the large recalls involving faulty General Motors small-car ignition switches and unintended acceleration involving Toyota vehicles. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office recommended that NHTSA develop plans to use data collected on recalls to analyze patterns and trends. That recommendation is still open, according to the inspector general's report. In the Takata case, the inspector general said that NHTSA managers did not make sure their staff sufficiently monitored repairs or the size of recalls before the agency and Takata reached a broad recall agreement in May of 2015. The agency did not act quickly on an August 2013 consumer complaint that indicated the Takata recalls didn't cover enough vehicles. The inaction ""may have delayed recalls of affected vehicles,"" the report said. Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high heat and humidity and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister designed to contain the explosion. That can hurl shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 23 people have been killed and about 300 injured worldwide because of the problem, which forced Takata into bankruptcy protection. The problem touched off the largest series of recalls in U.S. automotive history covering 37 million vehicles and more than 50 million vehicles. The inspector general found that NHTSA's ""minimal action"" to address low Takata recall completion rates ""may have contributed to the slow implementation of these recalls between 2008 and 2015."" The report recommendations include having NHTSA develop a process to monitor reporting of recall repairs, the size of recalls and the risk of the defects. It said the process should include taking ""appropriate steps"" with manufacturers that don't obey recall rules, ""including enforcement actions when necessary.""",1639,1644,Auto Brand,391

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING US construction spending up 0.7 percent in December WASHINGTON (AP) — Construction spending rose 0.7 percent in December to a record high. It was the fifth consecutive monthly gain with all major sectors showing modest increases. The Commerce Department said Thursday the December increase followed a 0.6 percent rise in November. It closed out a year in which construction spending rose 3.8 percent. It was the sixth straight annual increase but the weakest performance since a decline in 2011, a period when spending fell for five years as builders struggled to emerge from the housing bust and the Great Recession. For December, spending on housing projects rose 0.5 percent while nonresidential construction was up a stronger 1.1 percent. Spending on government projects rose 0.3 percent as strength at the federal level offset a drop in state and local construction. MORTGAGE RATES Long-term US mortgage rise for fourth straight week WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose for the fourth straight week. The rates on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages and five-year adjustable-rate mortgages hit the highest level since 2011. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac says the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.22 percent this week, highest since March and up from 4.15 percent a week earlier. They stood at 4.19 a year ago. The rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans, popular among homeowners who refinance, rose to 3.68 percent this week, highest since July 2011 and up from 3.62 percent last week and 3.41 percent a year ago. The five-year, adjustable rate rose to 3.53 percent from 3.52 percent last week and the highest since April 2011. PRODUCTIVITY US productivity falls at 0.1 percent rate in fourth quarter WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. productivity edged down at a 0.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. It was the weakest showing in nearly two years and further evidence of the struggles the country is having boosting worker efficiency. The Labor Department said Thursday that the fourth quarter decline followed a much stronger 2.7 percent gain in the third quarter. Labor costs increased at a 2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after two quarters of declines. For the year, productivity rose 1.2 percent, a rebound from a decline of 0.1 percent in 2016, which had been the first annual decline in 34 years. But the rebound still left the average productivity gain over the last decade at 1.2 percent, less than half the 2.6 percent average annual increases seen from 2000 to 2006. TAX OVERHAUL-BIGGER PAYCHECKS Tax bill beginning to deliver bigger paychecks to workers UNDATED (AP) — The contentious tax overhaul is beginning to deliver a change that many will welcome: bigger paychecks. Workers are starting to see more take-home pay as employers implement the new withholding guidelines from the IRS, which dictate how much employers withhold from pay for federal taxes. Those whose checks have remained the same shouldn't fret — employers have until Feb. 15 to make the changes. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that the new rules will mean more take-home pay for about 90 percent of American workers. How much extra cash? It depends on several factors, such as workers' income, how often they are paid and the number of withholdings allowances they claim on their IRS Form W-4 with their employer. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a middle-income household would on average get a tax cut of $930 this year, lifting their after-tax income by about 1.6 percent. That increase won't be perfectly reflected in their paycheck, though. That's because lower tax withholding on paychecks is just a piece of a complicated set of changes to tax law that the GOP pushed through in December. And what your employer withholds is based on an estimate of your tax obligation that includes many complex factors, but it's not a perfect measure. TAX OVERHAUL-LOWE'S Lowe's to hand out bonuses, sweeten benefits amid tax cuts NEW YORK (AP) — Home improvement chain Lowe's says it's handing out bonuses of up to $1,000 for its more than 260,000 hourly employees, as it becomes the latest major employer to invest in its workers after Congress approved a tax cut that will help businesses. The chain, based in Mooresville, North Carolina, also will be sweetening benefits for maternity and parental leave as well as adoption assistance. The bonuses, which will be given out to both part-time and full-time hourly workers across all its U.S. facilities including distribution centers, will be paid in addition to Lowe's long-standing, store-level bonus program. Lowe's joins a list of other national companies likes Walmart Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Starbucks Corp., which are embracing measures like giving out bonuses, enhancing maternity benefits and raising wages. AUTO SALES Automakers report January sales DETROIT (AP) — Automakers are reporting their January sales figures. General Motors' sales rose 1 percent from a year ago. GM's Buick and Chevrolet brands both posted gains, but its GMC and Cadillac brands saw lower sales. GM's best-seller, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup, saw a 14.5 percent jump in demand. A new Silverado will hit the market later this year, so GM is heavily discounting the outgoing truck. Ford says its sales fell 6.6 percent, due in part to a decline in sales to rental car fleets. But its average sales price hit a record $37,000 per vehicle in January, largely due to a 1.6 percent sales increase in the F-Series pickup. Ford's car sales were down 23.3 percent. Even its SUV sales fell by 5.9 percent. Toyota posted a 16.8 percent increase. The company attributed the rise to strong demand for the RAV4, Highlander and 4Runner SUVs, which hit January sales records. Sales of the revamped Camry midsize car bucked the trend toward SUV sales by rising 21.3 percent. Nissan Group says its sales rose 10 percent to 123,538, a January record for the company that sells the Nissan and Infiniti brands. Sales were led by the Rogue small SUV, which was up nearly 26 percent. Fiat Chrysler sales were down 13 percent. Jeep brand sales rose 2 percent but other brands struggled. Chrysler fell 21 percent while Dodge was off 31 percent and Fiat sales dropped 43 percent. Even the Ram truck brand posted a 16 percent sales decline. Volkswagen sales were up 5.2 percent. The German automaker is recovering from sales losses due to its diesel emissions cheating scandal by introducing new SUVs. MITSUBISHI RECALL Mitsubishi recalls SUV and car models; belt can come loose DETROIT (AP) — Mitsubishi is recalling some of its top-selling models in the U.S. because the accessory drive belt can come loose and cause engines to stall. The recall covers just over 141,000 Outlander SUVs from 2008 through 2012, Outlander Sport SUVs from 2011 through 2012, Lancer cars from 2009 through 2012 and Lancer Sportbacks from 2010 through 2012. All have Mitsubishi's 4B11 or 4B12 engines. The automaker says a flange that automatically adjusts the belt tension can crack, causing the belt to detach. That will drain the battery and cause the engine to stall. It was unclear if there have been any crashes or injuries. Dealers will replace the belt tensioner with an improved one at no cost to owners. The recall is to begin March 27.

591,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford made the wrong bet on small pickup trucks in 2011. It hopes to put things right — and win back customers — with the 2019 Ford Ranger. Ford is unveiling the North American version of the Ranger on Sunday ahead of the Detroit auto show. It goes on sale next spring, eight years after Ford pulled it off the market in the U.S. and Canada. Back then, the cheap but dependable Ranger was the best-selling truck of its size. But gas prices were high, demand was dwindling and the struggling company wanted to devote more resources to hybrids and to improving fuel economy in its full-size F-150 pickup. The company shuttered the 86-year-old Minnesota factory where the Ranger was made. ""It was politically correct to cast aside pickups at the time,"" says Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis for the market research firm AutoPacific. A rival small pickup, the Dodge Dakota, was pulled off the market the same year. The Ford factory is still closed, but everything else has changed. Gas prices are low. Ford is profitable and has the cash to invest in new vehicles. And while the market for midsize trucks did get smaller after peaking in the mid-1990s, it never went away. Automakers sold 448,000 midsize pickups in the U.S. in 2016; that's forecast to grow to 470,000 in 2019, according to the consulting company IHS Markit. The midsize Chevrolet Colorado and Toyota Tacoma both notched sales increases last year even though overall U.S. sales were down. Ford has continued selling the Ranger abroad; it's the best-selling pickup in Europe and New Zealand. But in the U.S., it thought buyers who needed to haul things occasionally would gravitate toward SUVs. The company gradually realized there was still U.S. demand for a smaller, easy-to-maneuver pickup. So much demand, in fact, that GM shifted van production out of its Wentzville, Missouri, plant so it could make more midsize trucks. Affordability was also an issue, says Todd Eckert, Ford's truck marketing manager. As buyers add more features to full-size trucks, the average price of an F-Series pickup has crept past $45,000. By contrast, the Colorado starts at $20,200. Ford isn't yet releasing pricing, but it will be competitive with other midsize trucks. Ford will market the Ranger as a vehicle for urban adventurers. It has a terrain management system that automatically adjusts the transmission and vehicle controls for driving in snow, mud or sand. A new trail control feature maintains a set speed even on slow, bumpy trails. The North American Ranger shares its underpinnings with the Ranger that's on sale globally. But to meet U.S. safety standards and customer expectations, the frame was reinforced with high-strength steel. Steel bumpers were added in the front and rear to better resemble the F-150, which isn't a big seller outside North America. Under the hood is the same 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine that powers the Ford Mustang sports car. Ford says that will give the truck the power of a V6 engine with the fuel economy of a four-cylinder. It's mated to a 10-speed transmission. Unlike the Tacoma, Ford won't offer a manual transmission. Ford isn't yet releasing horsepower, fuel economy, payload or towing capacity. The Ranger will be offered in two-door or four-door configurations with a choice of a 5-foot or 6-foot bed. That will suit Dan MacLeod, 28, an insurance broker from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, who wants room for car seats and a bed that will fit his hunting and fishing gear. MacLeod used to drive an F-150 and now he drives a GMC Yukon SUV, but he prefers Ford trucks and will buy a Ranger if he likes what he sees. But other fans are already dismissing the new Ranger. Alex Orians, a sophomore at Xavier University who is originally from Canton, Ohio, owns a 1996 Ranger, but he doesn't like the rounded styling of the new Ranger. Orians also suspects that while the Ranger has sentimental value for some drivers, most will prefer something more capable and comfortable. ""If I had the capital for a new pickup, an F-150 would be the first place I'd look,"" Orians said. Stephanie Brinley, a senior analyst with IHS, says as long as consumer confidence remains strong — and it was at a 17-year high in November — there will be a niche market for rugged trucks like the Ranger. ""It appeals to your ability to do whatever you want,"" she said.",1389,1394,Auto Brand,394
595,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Automakers, manufacturers and classic-car enthusiasts are coming out against President Donald Trump's plan to consider taxing imported cars, trucks and auto parts. General Motors warned in a filing Friday with the U.S. Commerce Department that the threat of auto tariffs ""risks undermining GM's competitiveness against foreign auto producers"" by driving up the cost of imported components and raises the risk that GM will face retaliation in other countries. The National Association of Manufacturers said in its filing that that the tariff plan would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States."" And Toyota Motor North America said the tariffs ""would have a negative impact on all manufacturers, increasing the cost of imported vehicles as well as domestically produced vehicles that rely on imported parts"" — such as the company's Kentucky-built Camry. Friday is the deadline for public comments on Trump's call for a Commerce investigation into whether auto imports pose enough of a threat to U.S. national security to justify tariffs. The president has cited national security concerns as the reason for slapping tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, drawing retaliatory tariffs from the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Turkey and India. Car collector Guy Mace of Springfield, Missouri, was one of many classic-car enthusiasts who wrote in to call for used cars and parts to be excluded from any tariff. ""Antique and classic cars (have) nothing to do with national security,"" Mace wrote. ""A wide ranging industry is involved the collection of antique and classic cars, and literally thousands of car enthusiasts, auction houses and repair/restoration shops derive their livelihood from this industry."" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the department had received 2,500 comments and expected more by Friday's deadline. ""The purpose of the comment period and of the public hearing scheduled for July 19th and 20th is to make sure that all stakeholders' views are heard, both pro and con,"" Ross said in statement.

660,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. sales of new cars and trucks tailed off in February as automakers eased up on discounts. Sales fell 2 percent from last February to 1.3 million, according to Autodata Corp. Among major automakers, only Toyota, Subaru and Volkswagen reported sales gains over last February. Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said automakers spent an average of $65 less per vehicle on incentives in February compared to the same month last year. That's a stark contrast from 2017, when incentive spending often climbed $300 or $400 per month. LaNeve said discounts could grow during the spring and summer, when tax returns arrive and more people shop for vehicles. But based on the first two months of this year, he expects automakers to remain fairly disciplined. In the past, heavy discounting has led to overproduction and steep declines in automakers' profits. Here are some details regarding February sales: — General Motors Co. sales fell just under 7 percent to 220,905. Sales were dragged down by the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, GM's top-selling vehicle. Silverado sales were off more than 16 percent from a year ago, when the company had record February sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. GMC and Chevrolet sales were down for the month but Buick and Cadillac sales rose. — Ford Motor Co. sales also fell 7 percent to 194,132. Ford said its car and SUV sales were down but sales of the F-Series pickup — its biggest seller — inched up 3.5 percent. Ford brand sales were down 6 percent while luxury Lincoln sales plummeted 23 percent. — Toyota Motor Corp. sales rose 4.5 percent to 182,195 vehicles. Sales of its top-seller, the Camry sedan, jumped 12 percent as an updated version went on sale. Luxury Lexus sales also rose 5 percent. — Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 1 percent to 165,903. Jeep brand sales jumped 12 percent and Alfa Romeo sales were also up, but Ram truck sales fell 14 percent because of a drop in fleet buyers. Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat sales also fell on low consumer demand for cars. — Nissan Motor Co. sales fell 4 percent to 129,930. Demand for Nissan cars fell 17 percent but truck and SUV sales were up 9 percent, led by the Rogue small SUV. Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand saw sales fall 7 percent. — Honda Motor Co. sales fell 5 percent to 115,557. Sales of its best-seller, the CR-V SUV, dropped 19 percent despite a recent redesign. Luxury Acura sales were up 1 percent. — Hyundai Motor Co. sales fell 13 percent to 46,095 as higher sales of SUVs failed to make up for declining car sales. Genesis luxury sales also slid 14 percent. — Subaru brand sales rose 4 percent to 47,209.

689,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of a Senate panel voiced frustration Tuesday with the pace of repairs for vehicles with defective Takata air bag inflators and urged regulators to complete work on a federal rule that would require automakers to use email and other forms of electronic communication when notifying car owners about recall campaigns. Takata air bag inflators can explode with too much force and spew shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 22 people have died worldwide and more than 180 have been hurt. A yearslong recall involves about 50 million Takata air bag inflators in the United States. To date, about 21 million defective air bags have been repaired. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee recently asked the 19 automakers involved in the Takata recall to provide the repair rates for their vehicles. Nelson said the completion rates for the most widely affected companies ranged from Honda Motor Co., 70 percent; Toyota Motor Corp, 61 percent; Fiat Chrysler, 41 percent; and Ford Motor Co, 22 percent. He said BMW failed to provide the committee with its most recent figures. ""Overall, these recall completion rates are disappointing, unacceptable and remain a cause for great concern,"" Nelson said. Heidi King of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acknowledged that repair rates are ""not where we want them to be."" She said the agency is exploring new ways to reach consumers and improve response rates to recall notifications. But King could not tell lawmakers when the agency would finish writing the rule that would require automakers to use electronic communications in its recall notices as well as traditional mail. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., asked if the rule would be issued this year. King would only say it's ""in progress."" ""Send a clear signal to the industry as to what is required,"" Markey said. ""The longer this goes, the more endangered the public is."" The federal government has described the Takata recall as the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. history.

693,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing a key concern for manufacturers, President Donald Trump has instructed his administration to explore negotiations with California on achieving a single fuel economy standard for the nation during a meeting with auto industry executives. The president met with top auto executives Friday to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs. A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months. Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards. The EPA under Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025. The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard. If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales. Any big change by Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states. In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard. ""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina. As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily. Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens."" ""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable."" Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices. When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales. Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump. Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said. Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars. Auto executives attending the meeting included Marchionne, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett and Bob Carter, executive vice president of North America for Toyota. __ Krisher reported from Detroit. __ On Twitter follow Tom Krisher at http://twitter.com/TKrisher and Ken Thomas at http://twitter.com/KThomasDC",5730,5735,Auto Brand,400
707,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Toyota dominated NASCAR's top series the last three years, winning nearly half the races and two championships. It forced Chevrolet and Ford to play catch-up. Chevy was fastest in its bid to close the gap by building a new Camaro, which is making its debut at Daytona International Speedway. Ford is expected to be next with a new body, a plan team owner Roger Penske revealed is on schedule for 2019. Assuming that happens, all three car brands will have unveiled new rides in back-to-back-to-back years. It's Car Wars in NASCAR, where manufacturers are constantly making changes to not only keep up with each other but in hopes of finding an aerodynamics advantage in the ultra-competitive racing world where thousandths of a second matter. ""We're in a pressure sport, I can tell you that,"" said Jim Campbell, vice president of Chevrolet's performance vehicles and motorsports. ""We definitely understand that piece of it."" The Camaro already made a splash during Speedweeks, landing the pole for the Daytona 500 when Alex Bowman put the No. 88 on the front row. The new Camaro also won a qualifying race with Chase Elliott, Bowman's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports. It had to be a relief after 2017. Chevy won 10 races, but none in the final 10 weeks of the season, and didn't advance any drivers into the championship event at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The bowtie brand also lost the manufacturers' championship for the second consecutive year, which hadn't happened since 2000. Even though Jimmie Johnson surprisingly won the Cup Series title in 2016 for Chevrolet, the performance of the Chevy SS — on and off the track — was far from ideal. Sales of the rear-wheel-drive V8 sport sedan were downright awful. In 2014, the manufacturer sold a measly 2,479 of them in the United States. Sales of the $50,000 performance sedan picked up in recent years, but topped out at 4,055 in 2017. So the Camaro became the obvious replacement. ""This is our first opportunity to refresh and come with a new model,"" Campbell said. ""You can't do it at will."" Ford updated its Fusion in 2016. Toyota tweaked its Camry in 2013, 2015 and again last year. Now it's Chevy's turn. ""This one was really important to us, No. 1, to make sure we connect the track and the showroom together,"" Campbell said. ""We want authenticity: fuel-injected V8, rear-wheel drive configuration, manual transmission. That's how you buy it in the showroom; that's how you race it on the track. ...

TOP STORIES: GYM--DOCTOR-SEXUAL ABUSE-TEXAS DALLAS — A former trainer who worked alongside imprisoned ex-sports doctor Larry Nassar at the famed Karolyi gymnastics ranch in Texas was charged Friday with sexual assault. But prosecutors said there wasn't evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the couple who ran the facility, former national team coordinators Bela and Martha Karolyi. A grand jury indicted former trainer Debra Van Horn on one count of second-degree sexual assault of a child, making her the first person other than Nassar to be charged in direct connection with his assaults. Nassar — who is already serving decades in prison for sexual assault and possession of child pornography in Michigan — also was indicted Friday on six counts of the same charge. Walker County prosecutor Stephanie Stroud said the charges involved six victims but didn't provide details of the alleged assaults when announcing the charges at a news conference in Huntsville. When asked for specifics about the allegations against Van Horn, Walker County District Attorney David Weeks said only that she was charged as ""acting as a party"" with Nassar. By David Warren.

Rick Snyder on Friday vetoed the proposed weakening of a state law that keeps oceangoing cargo ships from releasing untreated ballast water in Michigan waters, saying the bill potentially could have increased the risk for introducing new aquatic invasive species into the Great Lakes. The legislation would have revised a 2005 law requiring saltwater vessels to use state-approved cleansing technology before discharging ballast water, which provides stability in rough seas. Scientists believe dozens of the invasive species that have reached the Great Lakes in recent decades arrived in ballast water. The bill would have allowed compliance with U.S. Coast Guard ballast water regulations as a standard for issuing state permits to oceangoing vessels engaged in Michigan port operations.

General Motors warned in a filing Friday with the U.S. Commerce Department that the threat of auto tariffs ""risks undermining GM's competitiveness against foreign auto producers"" by driving up the cost of imported components and raises the risk that GM will face retaliation in other countries. The National Association of Manufacturers said in its filing that that the tariff plan would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States."" And Toyota Motor North America said the tariffs ""would have a negative impact on all manufacturers, increasing the cost of imported vehicles as well as domestically produced vehicles that rely on imported parts"" — such as the company's Kentucky-built Camry.

VOLKSWAGEN-DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — A 60-year-old employee at Volkswagen's Chattanooga auto plant has filed a class-action lawsuit in which he contends the company is using a rebranding effort to discriminate against workers once they turn 50. The law firm that filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court said the named plaintiff is Jonathan Manlove of Ooltewah, who is a former supervisor at the Chattanooga plant. Attorney Kevin Sharp said the company is trying to change its image to a ""younger, sleeker company"" after an emissions scandal that has rocked VW since 2015. The law firm said the company announced it was ""becoming slimmer, leaner and younger"" just before Manlove was demoted last year. The firm said he has sought other positions but has been rebuffed.

727,"Depreciation may be the bane of new-car buyers, but it's also the reason so many shoppers buy used. We scoured our annual Edmunds New Car Buying Guides from years past to see what cars we loved back in the day can now be had for $15,000 or less. For each vehicle, we've provided a range of years offering the best selection and value. In certain cases, getting an even older model is a viable option, too. SMALL CARS The is a great place to begin our list. We didn't like this generation Civic much when it came out for 2011, but Honda improved it dramatically by 2013. It's spacious and easy to live with, and it offers quite a few technology options. It's also available as a fuel-sipping hybrid or as the fun-to-drive 205-horsepower Civic Si. For more luxurious comfort and safety, check out the and the . This Volvo has front seats perfect for long hauls, and the available engines are surprisingly peppy. If you value performance over practicality, try the . It never sold in big numbers, but this littlest BMW provides lots of fun in either coupe or convertible guise. Finally, the combines fun with hatchback practicality. The GTI has always been one of our favorites thanks to its refined driving experience and near-luxury interior. MIDSIZE CARS The marked a turning point for Cadillac, challenging European competitors with its quality, comfort and driving precision. Look for CTS models with the 3.6-liter direct-injected V6, which puts out 304 horsepower without sacrificing fuel economy. The is a good all-arounder that didn't stand out from the crowd when new. But for under $15,000, it makes a compelling alternative to a used Accord. Look for one with the Ttechnology package to get the rearview camera and upgraded sound and navigation systems. For something a little newer, try the . Like many Mazdas, a used Mazda 6 can be a little hard to find, but its handling is among the best in the class. An upscale interior, plenty of backseat room, and an easy-to-use technology interface round out the appeal of this late-model midsize car. SUVs The safe bet for used SUVs is the . It's a practical, reliable compact SUV, if not the most exciting to drive. In 2015, the CR-V was updated with a more fuel-efficient engine. We also recommend the , especially in Touring or Grand Touring trim. The CX-5 has an upscale interior and excellent handling, returns good fuel economy, and is just as practical as competitors. If you want a three-row crossover, check out the with its distinctive big-wagon styling. It's one of the better-driving three-rows, with an available turbocharged V6 engine, lots of passenger space and cross-country roadtrip-worthy comfort. Another solid option is the . Its athletic road manners are complemented by comfortable seats, three usable rows and plenty of cargo capacity. Just note that its crash safety scores weren't the best. HYBRIDS There's no shortage of Toyota Priuses around, but we prefer the . It provides reasonable acceleration for a hybrid, along with a comfortable interior and ride, and it returns about 40 mpg. It's not quite as efficient as the Prius, but it's nicer to live with day to day. We're going to break one of our rules for this next one: We never featured the in an Edmunds Buying Guide, but it's a great used pick. New, it fell short of its promise of being a sporty hybrid, but as a Prius alternative it's an appealing proposition. It's more luxurious and better to drive and returns 42 mpg in combined (city and highway) driving. TRUCKS AND VANS While there is no end of old Ford F-150s and Chevrolet Silverados available, our pick has to be the . This rugged, durable truck offers a burly V8 that can tow up to 10,000 pounds. Unless you're a patient bargain hunter, you might have to opt for a slightly higher-mileage Tundra, but we think the extra miles are worth it for such a capable truck. Buyers looking for something smaller should check out the Tundra's popular little brother, the Tacoma. If you need to haul people rather than bricks, the is your best bet. Compared to its predecessor, the redesigned 2011 Odyssey sports more interior space and offers more upgrades including a premium stereo, chilled storage box and rear-seat entertainment system. Pre-2011 Odysseys are great choices, too. EDMUNDS SAYS: No matter which vehicle you choose, remember to do your research to make sure you're getting the best used car for your money.

734,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Japanese automakers Toyota and Mazda on Wednesday announced plans to build a mammoth $1.6 billion joint-venture plant in Alabama that will eventually employ about 4,000 people. Several states had competed for the coveted project, which will be able to turn out 300,000 vehicles per year and produce the Toyota Corolla compact car for North America and a new small SUV from Mazda. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and company executives held a joint news conference to announce that the facility is coming to the Huntsville area not far from the Tennessee line. Production is expected to begin by 2021. ""This is indeed a great day in Alabama,"" Ivey said. ""Thank you for believing in the potential of our people in the great state of Alabama. ... To Toyota and Mazda, thank you so much. Welcome to sweet home Alabama To lure the plant, the state offered an incentive package of $379 million in tax abatements, investment rebates and the construction of a worker training facility. Alabama Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said that figure does not include a local incentive package that is still being finalized. ""It is a great honor to announce that Toyota and Mazda will be building a new vehicle plant here. I'd like to express our sincere appreciation for the people of Alabama and Huntsville for their support,"" said Masamichi Kogai, CEO and president of Mazda Motor Corporation. Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motors, said the new facility is something of a homecoming since the company already has one plant in the state. The new Huntsville plant will be just 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Alabama, which produces four-cylinder, V-6 and V-8 engines for several Toyota models. The decision to pick Alabama is another example of foreign-based automakers building U.S. factories in the South. To entice manufacturers, Southern states have used a combination of lucrative incentive packages, low-cost labor and a pro-business labor environment since the United Auto Workers union is stronger in Northern states. Alabama was already tied with Tennessee as the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in the country last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The state produced 9 percent of the cars made in the U.S., the center said. ""Alabama won a first place trophy today in being selected for that plant,"" said Dave Sullivan, product analysis manager at AutoPacific Inc., an automotive research company. Sullivan said the factory itself is a huge asset for the state, but it will also cause economic ripples by bringing spinoff jobs at suppliers and service companies in the area. The announcement comes at a time that U.S. sales of small cars fell nearly 10 percent last year as buyers continued a massive shift toward SUVs and pickup trucks. Corolla sales fell 14 percent for the year, to just less than 309,000, according to Autodata Corp. Still, Toyota and Mazda have said their collaboration will respect mutual independence and equality. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, already provides hybrid technology to Mazda, which makes compact cars for Toyota at its Mexico plant. The sheer cost of the plant also makes a partnership logical, as it boosts cost-efficiency and economies of scale. Working together on green and other auto technology also makes sense as the segment becomes increasingly competitive because of concerns about global warming, the environment and safety. Alabama started on the road to becoming an auto manufacturing hub in 1993 when Mercedes chose it as the location for a manufacturing plant after the state offered a then-eye popping $250 million incentive package. Honda and Hyundai have since founded assembly plants in the state. ____ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher contributed to this story from Detroit, Michigan.",44,49,Auto Brand,404

BUDGET BATTLE Senate advances bill to reopen government WASHINGTON (AP) — It looks like the government shutdown will end soon. The Senate has advanced a bill reopening federal agencies through Feb. 8 after Democrats relented and lifted their blockade against the legislation. The shutdown began Saturday after Democrats derailed a Republican measure that would have kept government open until Feb. 16. Democrats wanted to pressure the GOP to cut a deal protecting young immigrants from deportation and boosting federal spending. Moderates from both parties pressured leaders to end the shutdown and compromise. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats agreed to back the bill reopening government after he and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to begin debating an immigration bill by Feb. 8. The Senate vote was 81-18 — well above the 60 votes needed. The Senate still must vote on final passage to send the bill to the House. AUDI-DIESEL German authorities tell Audi to recall 127,000 diesels FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany's transport ministry is telling Volkswagen's Audi brand to recall 127,000 cars diesel cars that reduce emissions controls when not being tested. The ministry says it examined Audi diesel engines designed to meet the latest Euro 6 emissions standard and found that under real driving conditions there was ""no reduction"" of harmful nitrogen oxides. A spokeswoman says 77,600 of the cars were registered in Germany and that the affected models were: the A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q5, SQ5 and Q7. Audi must first agree on a fix with the agency and then notify owners of the repair action. Audi says the cars were already part of a voluntary upgrade action affecting some 850,000 vehicles to improve emissions performance. AMAZON GO STORE Amazon opens store with no cashiers, lines or registers SEATTLE (AP) — No cashiers, no lines, no registers — this is how Amazon sees the future of in-store shopping. The online retailer opened its Amazon Go concept store to the public today, selling milk, potato chips and other items typically found at a convenience shop. Amazon employees have been testing the store, which is at the bottom floor of the company's Seattle headquarters, for about a year. The public opening is another sign that Amazon is serious about expanding its physical presence. It has opened more than a dozen bookstores, taken over space in some Kohl's department stores and bought Whole Foods last year, giving it 470 grocery stores. But Amazon Go is unlike its other stores. Shoppers enter by scanning the Amazon Go smartphone app at a turnstile. When they pull an item of the shelf, it's added to their virtual cart. If the item is placed back on the shelf, it is removed from the virtual cart. Shoppers are charged when they leave the store. The company says it uses computer vision, machine learning algorithms and sensors to figure out what people are grabbing off its store shelves. WORLD ECONOMY-IMF IMF hikes outlook for global growth for 2017 to 3.7 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund is upgrading the outlook for the world economy, noting surprisingly strong growth in Europe and Asia and predicting that U.S. tax cuts will give the American economy a short-term boost. The IMF is forecasting global growth of 3.7 percent for 2017, which would be the most substantial annual growth since 2011, and to 3.9 percent for this year and 2019. The international lending agency says 120 countries, representing three-quarters of world economic output, enjoyed economic growth in 2017, creating the broadest global expansion in seven years. World trade is expanding, and consumers are more confident. The IMF expects the U.S. growth to accelerate to 2.7 percent this year, from 2.3 percent in 2017, citing increased investment as businesses take advantage of lower corporate tax rates. DAVOS FORUM Davos founder hopes Trump and his critics keep open minds DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — The founder of the World Economic Forum says he hopes President Donald Trump's planned visit to Davos this week will ""provide him even better with a global perspective,"" and says critics of the U.S. leader should hear him out. Klaus Schwab couldn't confirm whether Trump will actually attend the WEF event in the Alpine snows on Friday, as scheduled, because of the U.S. government shutdown. The White House has previously said that Trump would detail his ""America First"" stance — which doesn't always square with the Davos globalist mindset — and that it was assessing day by day whether the government shutdown might derail his trip. More than 60 heads of state and government, plus hundreds of business leaders, academics, civil society advocates and celebrities are meeting in Davos from Tuesday to Friday, an event featuring roughly 400 debates and panels on topics like action on the environment, the outlook for Africa, and ways that refugees can contribute to their host countries.

Macron wants to promote his business-friendly policies, including measures to ease France's labor rules and tax changes that aim to attract foreign investors. Today he's visiting a Toyota plant in northern France before heading to the evening business event at the chateau of Versailles, in the presence of 15 French government ministers.

IRAQ-GAS Iraq signs rare gas deal with US firm BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq has signed a deal with a U.S. company to tap natural gas in one of its southern oil fields, a step toward exploiting a natural resource that has been neglected for decades. Iraq has long flared much of its natural gas, a byproduct of pumping crude oil, because of a lack of infrastructure. But the Memorandum of Understanding signed today would allow Orion Gas Processors to capture and process up to 150 million cubic feet per day of associated gas from the Nahr Bin Omar field. Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaib described the agreement as an ""important step"" to ""end the wasting of resources."" The field has a current daily output of more than 40,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of gas.

784,"CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — It's been 16 years since Mark Martin won the Coca-Cola 600, and a Ford driver has not been to victory lane for the marquee event since. A Ford driver hasn't hoisted a Cup championship trophy since 2004, either. There have been some highlights during this past decade of mediocrity, but coming up empty every year in the chase for NASCAR's biggest prize got very tiring to the Ford group. ""Four years ago we got very serious about, 'We don't just want to be here, we want to be here to win,'"" said Mark Rushbrook, global director at Ford Motor Co. ""To do that, we knew we had to fix everything."" Ford Performance was launched along with a technical center created as the headquarters for engineers to assist its teams across multiple series. Its first success came two years later when Ford returned to Le Mans on the 50th anniversary of its 1966 victory and won the GT class. Gains have been made across all Ford's motorsports programs, and the company is currently the hottest manufacturer in NASCAR. Ford has won seven of the 12 Cup points races this season, its 2,296 laps led account for 59 percent and Ford drivers have 17 stage victories. Kevin Harvick is the force behind that success with five Cup victories, including the last two. Add his Saturday night win in the $1 million All-Star race, and Harvick is on a three-race winning streak. That bodes well for Ford in Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600, a race Ford drivers won four consecutive years from 1999-2002. The blue oval has not triumphed in NASCAR's longest race of the year since. Harvick has five of the Ford seven wins this season, and Joey Logano and Clint Bowyer have also been to victory lane. Ford drivers hold seven of the top 10 spots in the Cup standings. Matt Kenseth, who drove a Ford to two Daytona 500 wins and the 2003 championship, returned to the manufacturer earlier this month to help Roush Fenway Racing catch Ford front-runners Stewart-Haas Racing and Team Penske. Logano, winner at Talladega this year, noted Toyota was the dominating brand at this point last season. SHR, in its first year with Ford, wasn't a strong title contender and Penske drivers Logano and Brad Keselowski felt overmatched in their aged Fusions. Ford will move to the Mustang in an update in 2019, but tweaks to the rules package have helped Ford teams catch Toyota. ""Last year, the Toyotas were on fire and really good,"" Logano said. ""I think this year with some of the rules changes and really the way the rules have been regulated, enforced, it has brought it to more of an equal playing field."" Kurt Busch was the last Ford driver to win a Cup title, in the 2004 launch of the playoff system, and it capped consecutive championships for the manufacturer. He believes the commitment from the company has always been the same, from Edsel Ford II on down, but the engineering support has dramatically improved. ""The Ford Performance group, I see it everywhere, with all their different forms of motorsport collaborating together,"" Busch said. ""Whereas Ford Racing before ... felt like it was more focused on the NASCAR program and didn't use information from IndyCar or Cosworth in Formula One or sports cars. What I see now is information channels that are able to communicate quickly and gather data from all different branches of motorsports that Ford is involved in."" Ford Performance initially housed a simulator used exclusively by its NASCAR teams. IMSA and WEC programs began using it, and the simulator has graduated into use for both Ford Performance production cars and now mainstream Ford products. To prepare for Le Mans, the drivers from Chip Ganassi Racing drove thousands of miles of Le Mans simulation so that the track would not be foreign when the manufacturer made its ballyhooed return. Ford's sole intent was to celebrate its 50th anniversary victory by winning the race, and with just one test on the track before the 24-hour race, the Tech Center was critical in preparing the program. Ford Performance began with seven engineers in 2013 and now has 45. They are busy preparing the Mustang for Cup introduction next year, and also the Mustang for the Supercars Series in Australia. Rushbrook said Ford Performance is reminded often about its Cup championship drought, and believes the program has nine drivers capable of winning races and contending for the title. Harvick is having a season like Truex did last year in which the championship appears to be his and Ford's to lose, but the Ford program is strong across the board.

806,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. announced Thursday that it will invest $170 million and add 400 jobs at its Mississippi assembly plant as it shifts some production of the Corolla sedan from Canada. The company said it will retool the Blue Springs plant beginning later this year to make its next-generation Corolla sedan. Such changeovers are frequent at auto plants, but this one will also increase the plant's capacity. Spokeswoman Kathryn Ragsdale said Toyota now can make 170,000 vehicles yearly at the northeast Mississippi plant. Ragsdale couldn't say how much capacity would increase after production lines are replaced. The spending brings Toyota's total investment in Mississippi to $1.16 billion. Although Corolla sales are declining right now, Ragsdale said the company believes a 2020 redesign will boost sales. More importantly, the company is pulling Corolla production from its Cambridge, Ontario, plant to build more RAV4 SUVs there. Toyota had planned to shift Corolla production to Mexico, but then decided to build pickups there, leaving Blue Springs and a new plant that Toyota and Mazda are jointly building in Huntsville, Alabama, as the sites for North American Corolla production. ""The world is looking forward to these additional Corollas,"" Gov, Phil Bryant told a crowd at the plant. ""They're looking forward to this 2020 platform, and we want to make sure we're providing every auto they need."" Bryant, a Republican, also said he hoped Mississippi would be able to attract more automotive suppliers to serve Blue Springs and the Huntsville plant. The factory, which has 2,000 workers now, began production in 2011. Part of the investment involves overhauling it to accommodate Toyota's New Global Architecture, an engineering system that allows Toyota to share certain parts and components among several vehicles and quickly shift assembly lines to make more popular vehicles. ""The Toyota New Global Architecture allows us to completely change how we design and produce vehicles,"" said Sean Suggs, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi. Suggs said the 400 new assembly workers are being hired by contract labor agency ResourceMFG over the next year. They'll make about $31,000 yearly to start, Ragsdale said. She said that after two years or more, those workers are likely to be offered a chance to become direct Toyota employees. Toyota's 1,500 direct employees have wages between $36,600 and $53,600. State officials say the Japanese automaker will get incentives including property tax breaks and rebates on worker income taxes. However, those worker income tax rebates are only available for workers making above $41,000 a year, meaning some employees could make too little for Toyota to qualify, at least for part of the 10-year window. Under state law, Toyota gets a two-thirds break on its property taxes for 10 years on new investments. Such a break will probably be worth millions. State and local governments have already given Toyota more than $325 million in grants and tax breaks. Also Thursday, Toyota unveiled the design for a $10 million visitor and training center that it announced last year. Toyota has said it will invest $10 billion in United States facilities in the five years ending in 2022 and said Thursday that it is now $4.3 billion into that commitment. ___ Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jeffamy .

825,"TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. logged a better than expected performance in the last quarter, reporting Friday that its quarterly profit jumped 7.2 percent to a record 657.3 billion yen ($5.9 billion), thanks to strong sales in the U.S. and other overseas markets. The maker of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models said sales rose 4.5 percent, also to a record, of 7.4 trillion yen ($66 billion). Toyota's profit in the same quarter a year earlier was 613.0 billion yen. The results were better than expected given recent trends in the U.S. market and Japan, where Toyota's sales did fall in the April-June quarter, by almost 34,000 units. Cost cutting also helped trim 60 billion yen ($537 million) from expenses, the company said in a statement. With uncertainties over possible U.S. tariff increases clouding the horizon, the company kept its profit forecast for the full year unchanged at 2.12 trillion yen ($66 billion) and trimmed its global sales forecast further, to 8.9 million vehicles from the earlier estimated 8.95 million units. It said the forecasts do not take into account possible tariff hikes or other such changes. Toyota has invested heavily in U.S. manufacturing facilities, which should help soothe the sting from higher tariffs. But all the big Japanese automakers would hurt if President Donald Trump's administration follows through on threats to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts. Toyota has been lobbying against the tariff hike, sending staffers to stage protests on Capitol Hill. It says higher tariffs would raise vehicle prices by at least several thousand dollars apiece and could threaten the jobs of its 137,000 workers in the U.S. Despite its strong showing in the U.S. market in the last quarter, Toyota earlier reported that its sales in the U.S. fell 6 percent in July. Toyota again released its results before Tokyo's markets closed instead of waiting for the end of trading as has been standard practice for decades. Its share price fell 0.8 percent Friday in Tokyo. The company is banking on artificial intelligence and networking technology, as in connected and self-driving vehicles, to woo consumers. Toyota's executive vice president, Moritaka Yoshida, said in a presentation that the company is in a rare ""transformational"" period as regulations tighten and technology shifts to wired mobility and electric vehicles.

836,"DETROIT (AP) — Neither higher gas prices nor rising interest rates could put a damper on U.S. auto sales during the first half of the year. Sales rose 1.8 percent during the first half of the year, while June sales were up about 5 percent compared with a year ago, according to Edmunds.com. Analysts said the boost was fueled by strong consumer confidence and low unemployment. But analysts at Cox Automotive, which includes Kelley Blue Book, issued a cautionary note on the numbers, saying that much of the increase was due to low-profit sales to fleet buyers such as rental car companies, and retail sales to individual buyers were propped up by rising incentives such as rebates and subsidized leases. Sales are ""defying gravity"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox. ""Retail sales have been flat, and even those sales have been supported by incentives being up 6 percent."" Cox analysts also said rising interest rates and a possible trade war due to tariff threats from President Donald Trump could raise new-vehicle prices and payments and cut into auto sales in the second half. Still, given the fact that automakers are willing to spend to keep their share of the market, Cox analysts raised their full-year forecast by 100,000 vehicles to 16.8 million vehicles. Trucks and SUVs accounted for 68 percent of the market in June, a record high as car sales continued to fade, Edmunds said. The Federal Reserve in mid-June raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time and signaled that it may step up the pace of rate increases. The central bank raised its key short-term rate by a modest quarter-point to a still-low range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent. It means that consumers and businesses will face higher loan rates over time. But Cox analysts said auto interest rates held steady in June, although they expect them to rise. Bankrate.com said on its website new-auto loans are now around 4.75 percent. Gas prices rose 63 cents per gallon over a year ago to an average price for regular of $2.86, according to AAA, taking a bigger bite out of household budgets.

901,"Full-size trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-150 are hugely popular. But not everyone needs that much capability from a new pickup. For them, a midsize truck is a viable alternative. The latest midsize trucks are able to tow, haul and transport passengers nearly as well as their full-size brethren, yet they offer increased maneuverability, lower starting prices, and the potential for better fuel economy. Which one is the best? Edmunds rounds up the lot to explain their individual benefits and drawbacks. 2018 HONDA RIDGELINE The Ridgeline lacks the traditional body-on-frame construction that's typical for a truck, and softer-looking styling might have you thinking it's less capable. But the reality is that it's one of the most appealing and capable trucks in its segment. The Ridgeline is the comfortable and quiet truck here. It also offers some unique features. In the bed, for instance, there's a watertight storage trunk plus a two-way tailgate that you can open either up and down or sideways for easier loading. You can even add an in-bed stereo system as an option. Under the hood, the Ridgeline's 3.5-liter V6 engine provides smooth power and respectable fuel economy. The powertrain does have its limits, though, as its all-wheel-drive system isn't as capable for off-road use as the four-wheel-drive systems on competitors. And with that all-wheel-drive system, the Ridgeline's towing capacity tops out at just 5,000 pounds. 2018 TOYOTA TACOMA The Tacoma is one of the most capable pickup trucks on the road regardless of size. For truck shoppers wanting to go as far off the beaten path as possible, the Tacoma will be a great choice. It'll also tow up to 6,800 pounds, and it enjoys a great reputation for high resale value and aftermarket parts support. In other ways, however, the Tacoma isn't as dominant. The interior is bland, the driver's seating position can be uncomfortable, and the ride quality on the highway ride is subpar. Toyota offers two engines in the Tacoma, a base 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine or a 3.5-liter V6. The four-cylinder is adequate for some tasks, but we recommend upgrading to the available 3.5-liter V6. Overall, the Tacoma isn't the most refined midsize truck, but for most truck shoppers it's the most adventure-ready rig. 2018 CHEVROLET COLORADO AND GMC CANYON Chevrolet's smart-looking Colorado is easy to drive every day. We like its simple but easy-to-use interior and many of its available technology features upgrades. Chevy also offers the most choices for engines. The Colorado comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but you can upgrade to either a 3.6-liter V6 or a 2.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine. If you opt for the diesel, maximum towing capacity goes up to an impressive and class-leading 7,700 pounds. And while the Tacoma has traditionally been the undisputed midsize king of off-road country, there's now real competition from the purpose-built, off-road-ready Colorado ZR2. If you're looking for a bit more upscale vibe in your midsize truck, the GMC Canyon has the same underpinnings as the Colorado and more to offer on the options sheet. 2018 NISSAN FRONTIER Though the 2018 Nissan Frontier has a few upsides, it has the least overall appeal in our opinion. While the other midsize trucks benefit from recent and comprehensive redesigns, the Frontier has only received a few minor changes over the last decade. As such, cabin materials and construction feel dated from the moment you sit down. The uncomfortable seats and a strikingly bland dashboard display are decidedly uninspiring. On the highway, the Frontier continues to disappoint, with drawbacks like a noisy cabin and spongy brakes. Middling fuel economy and subpar safety scores are also significant knocks against it. The Frontier's list of advantages is short, but most notably it can cost significantly less than competitors. If you're looking for a bare-bones truck, the Frontier is appealing. But your driving experience will be much better in the Chevy, Honda or Toyota. 2019 FORD RANGER While it hasn't arrived on U.S. shores yet, the Ford Ranger warrants a mention in any discussion of midsize trucks. The Ranger has been absent from the U.S. market for several years, but Ford reintroduced an all-new Ranger at the Detroit Auto Show just a few months ago. It will go on sale late in 2018. The Ranger is set to receive a turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, which should provide decent towing and hauling capabilities, as well as the latest Ford technology features. Depending on your needs, this new Ranger might be worth waiting for. EDMUNDS SAYS: Midsize trucks are more capable and more appealing than ever, and they are a compelling alternative to full-size trucks if you want something that's more maneuverable. Whether you're into off-roading or just need to stick a few surfboards in the back, midsize pickups can provide all the utility you need. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

999,"Automakers have come a long way from safety features such as seat belts and air bags that are meant to prevent injuries in a crash. Today, manufacturers are adding advanced driver aids that can fend off an accident in the first place. And there's a good chance that your next new car will have them. What's an advanced driver aid? It's kind of like an autonomous sidekick that's ready to step in to help you prevent an imminent collision. Adaptive cruise control, for example, can adjust your cruise speed and following distance with respect to the vehicle ahead of you. It's often paired with automatic emergency braking that applies the brakes when the system senses a collision is about to occur and the driver doesn't react in time. Lane keeping assist, which automatically makes small steering corrections if it senses you drifting out of your lane, and blind-spot monitoring, which lets you know if a vehicle is hovering in your out-of-view rear quarters, are two other key technologies we've found valuable for improving safety. These features were once solely in the domain of expensive luxury cars. But the number of vehicles with a basic set of advance safety features is growing every year. We've highlighted four vehicles here. Each costs under $25,000 and has the features we've mentioned above, plus other qualities that make them attractive beyond their affordability. 2018 TOYOTA C-HR XLE ($23,495) The highly stylized is an all-new subcompact SUV sporting aggressive body lines and plenty of standard features. It's a good example of how Toyota is among the manufacturers leading the charge on making advanced safety tech standard across the board. Toyota Safety Sense is a basic suite of aids that many Toyota models receive. On the C-HR, it includes automatic emergency braking and lane departure alert. It also has automatic high beams that can detect if vehicles are present and can toggle between high- and low beams to maximize nighttime visibility and avoid blinding other drivers. In addition, the C-HR gets lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control that works to a standstill, and a special pre-collision system that can detect pedestrians and vehicles. The C-HR Premium trim, which would've exceeded our $25,000 cap by just $345, also includes blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. 2018 HONDA ACCORD LX ($24,460) As far as midsize sedans go, the comfortable and spacious is Edmunds' favorite. Even the base LX trim is satisfyingly easy to drive because of its quick acceleration and precise handling. The Accord's Honda Sensing suite of safety features is one of the most comprehensive around, with automatic braking, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist, and an adaptive cruise control that works down to a full stop, just like the C-HR's system. Additionally, the Accord's front-facing camera recognizes speed limit signs and displays that information discreetly in the instrument panel. We've found this feature surprisingly useful. SUBARU IMPREZA HATCHBACK 2.0i ($24,050) The is the only car on this list with standard all-wheel drive, an advantage if you frequently drive in wet or snowy conditions. This is a comfortable small car, and the hatchback model provides more rear headroom and cargo space than the Impreza sedan. Subaru calls its safety suite EyeSight, and it relies heavily on a sophisticated set of cameras that provide depth perception, much as human eyes do. Unlike the Toyota and Honda models on this list, EyeSight isn't standard equipment on the Impreza. The suite includes adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist and steering-responsive foglights that swivel to better light the road through bends. You'll have to get the midlevel Premium trim level and add EyeSight, but even so this Impreza sneaks in under our price cap at $24,050. 2018 NISSAN SENTRA SR W/ PREMIUM PACKAGE ($24,945) The has long been a staple in the small sedan segment. It may not be our overall favorite in the class, but considering the comfort features and advanced driver aids you can get for under $25,000, it's a bargain that's hard to overlook. The Sentra SR comes standard with automatic braking and adaptive cruise, though its cruise control operational range is between 20 and 90 mph and it won't stop for you. The Premium package adds blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, along with a slew of other luxuries such as leather upholstery, navigation, heated seats, a Bose audio system and more. EDMUNDS SAYS: Advanced driver aids have been around for some time and have proven effective at preventing road incidents, but they haven't always been affordable. That's changing now that many manufacturers view advanced safety technology as a necessity rather than a luxury. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1018,"FINANCIAL MARKETS Asian shares drop as eyes turn to central bank meetings. TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks mostly fell today after a muted market response to the Trump-Kim summit. Investors have now turned their eyes to the trio of this week's central bank meetings. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 finished up 0.4 percent today. South Korea's Kospi was down by less than 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite index both dropped 1.0 percent. On Wall Street Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 4.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,786.85, closing at its highest level since February 1. The Nasdaq composite added 43.87 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,703.79 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.58 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 25,320.73. The Russell 2000, an index that makes up mostly small companies, rose 7.62 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,682.30. FEDERAL RESERVE Anticipation surrounds Fed's rate forecasts after next hike WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is expected today to modestly raise its key short-term interest rate for the second time this year. But attention will be focused mainly on any hints that the Fed might accelerate its rate hikes in the coming months. Some economists think the Fed will signal that it expects to raise rates four times this year, up from its current projection of three hikes. Others believe the central bank will stick with its projection of three rate increases, partly out of concern that rising trade tensions triggered by President Donald Trump's aggressive policies might slow global growth. The policymakers will reveal their action in a policy statement and in updated economic forecasts, followed by a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell. AT&T-TIME WARNER AT&T happy with ruling, government weighs appeal WASHINGTON (AP) — AT&T says it will complete its purchase of Time Warner by June 20 now that a federal judge has cleared the deal. AT&T general counsel David McAtee says the company is ""pleased"" with the verdict after a ""full and fair trial on merits."" A statement from the government's top attorney says the Department of Justice is ""disappointed"" with the decision. It warns that the pay-TV industry will be ""less competitive and less innovative"" as a result of merger. The government could appeal. In Tuesday's ruling, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected the government's argument that the AT&T-Time Warner combination would hurt competition in pay TV and cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars more to stream TV and movies. In after-market trading following the ruling, shares of Time Warner rose nearly 5 percent and AT&T shares fell 1.6 percent. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox rose more than 4 percent, while Disney's stock dropped slightly more than 1 percent. Disney has a deal to buy the bulk of Fox, but Comcast is now expected to make a counterbid. AT&T-TIME WARNER-FUTURE MEDIA Comcast offer for Fox expected after favorable AT&T ruling NEW YORK (AP) — Now that a federal judge has cleared AT&T's $85 billion takeover of Time Warner, other companies are likely to rush to consolidate. Tuesday's ruling signaled that federal regulators will have a hard time stopping companies from getting bigger by gobbling up rivals and the content they own. Even if a company doesn't need to get bigger right away, it might need to do so to prevent a competitor from doing so. For starters, expect Comcast to make a bid for Fox's entertainment business as early as today. AMAZON-SEATTLE TAX Seattle repeals tax on companies after Amazon fights back SEATTLE (AP) — Seattle leaders on Tuesday repealed a tax on large companies such as Amazon and Starbucks after a backlash from businesses. The reversal came month after the City Council unanimously approved the effort to combat a growing homelessness crisis. A divided crowd chanted, jeered and booed at the council meeting, drowning out the leaders as they cast their 7-2 vote. Many shouted, ""Stop the repeal,"" as others unfurled a large red banner that read, ""Tax Amazon."" An opposing group held ""No tax on jobs"" signs. The vote showed Amazon's ability to aggressively push back on government taxes, especially in its affluent hometown where it's the largest employer with more than 45,000 workers. But Amazon has also been criticized by some for helping cultivate a widening income gap that is pricing lower-income workers out of housing. Seattle has one of the nation's highest homelessness numbers, a problem that hasn't eased even as city spending on the issue grew. JAPAN-TOYOTA-GRAB Toyota investing $1 billion in ride-hailing company Grab TOKYO (AP) — Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. is investing $1 billion in Grab, the leading ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia. Toyota says it reached a deal with Grab Holdings to strengthen a partnership they already have to grow in mobility services in that region. Toyota says one of its executives will be appointed to Grab's board and another Toyota person is being tapped to be an executive officer at Grab. Grab, which is similar in its services to Uber in the U.S., is in eight nations in the region, including Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. PAYDAY LENDING SCHEME Businessman gets 10 years in prison for payday loan scam NEW YORK (AP) — A businessman who ran a $220 million predatory payday lending operation that cheated more than a half million people nationwide while he lived lavishly was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a judge who said he couldn't understand how a once honorable man could go so crooked. Federal Judge Edgardo Ramos told Richard Moseley Sr. that he also must forfeit $49 million to make amends for running loan companies that exploited 620,000 of the most financially vulnerable people in the country. His companies had been charging interest rates as high as 700 percent or more using deceptive practices, including charging some people for loans they never requested, while he lived the high life, including a vacation home in Mexico, luxury cars and country club memberships. Moseley, who is 73, was convicted last November of racketeering, fraud and identity theft for crimes committed while he ran the company between 2004 and 2014. GHOST GUNS New Jersey attorney general asks makers of ghost guns to stop selling TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey's attorney general has demanded that firearms companies stop marketing and selling untraceable weapons, or ghost guns. The weapons are illegal in New Jersey, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a letter to the unidentified companies, and the state will sue the gun-makers if they persist. Grewal demanded the companies stop selling and advertising to New Jersey residents assault weapons that are unregistered and lack serial numbers. The companies have 15 days to respond. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, a National Rifle Association affiliate, has opposed the measures and said they won't ""make anyone safer."" HOG SMELLS-LAWSUITS No. 2 hog state moves to greatly help agribusiness in suits RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) —A North Carolina House committee on Tuesday approved legislation sharply limiting the ability of residents who live near industrial hog operations to punish the operations for causing severe nuisances.  The proposed law would all but block other neighbors from suing industrial-scale livestock operations in the future. Meanwhile, federal juries are just beginning to hear the first of more than 500 eastern North Carolina neighbors of Virginia-based Smithfield Foods. Smithfield Foods is owned by Hong Kong-headquartered WH Group, which generated $22 billion in revenues last year. Elvis Williams, who has lived on his land for 30 years, testified that he had to build a screen around his front porch because of blankets of flies spawned by a nearby industrial hog farm's uncovered cesspools. Williams and others say Smithfield can afford to eliminate nuisances including horrible stenches, flies and noise. SEXUAL MISCONDUCT-GUESS INC.

1027,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue headlines of the week. None of these stories is legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked these out. Here are the real facts: ___ NOT REAL: Home Sweet Home: Obama Secretly Returns To Kenya Ahead of Planned Trip THE FACTS: Former President Barack Obama did not return to his father's birthplace in Kenya this week despite an online report he was there on a secret trip. Rumors about the former president's whereabouts began swirling online after New York Magazine published a piece asking ""Where is Barack Obama?"" Big League Politics, a news website, suggested Obama had traveled to Kenya secretly before a scheduled trip in July, perhaps to deal with ""controversy surrounding the legitimacy of his birth certificate and country of his birth."" False reports that Obama was born in Kenya have been debunked. Obama's personal office confirmed to The Associated Press in a phone call Friday that he is not in Kenya. Obama was most recently seen Thursday where he attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. Obama is scheduled to visit Kenya July 15 and 16 and South Africa on July 16 through 19. ___ NOT REAL:  GLOBAL WARMING DEBUNKED: Arctic Ocean almost completely covered by ice THE FACTS:  A story circulating online that points to a sea ice thickness map as evidence that global warming is not happening is false. Powell Media, an online news site, is running a color-coded map from June 26, 2018, that shows ice thickness across the Arctic Ocean. The map, attributed to the Denmark-based monitoring group Polar Portal, shows that the ocean is almost totally covered by ice. ""On the 26th of June! Where's that (so-called) global warming?"" the site asks. Powell Media links to identical information published on Ice Age Now, an online site run by a non-scientist architect promoting a book that predicts a coming ice age. Scientists say the map — a daily look at ice levels — is simply a snapshot and does not provide perspective on what has happened to the ice over time. Sea ice fluctuates seasonally with the lowest levels in mid-September and highest levels in March. Mark Serreze, senior scientist and director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, said the idea the map reveals anything about global warming is ""nonsense."" He said there is always a lot of sea ice in June and this year's June extent is quite low compared to previous years. ___ NOT REAL:  TOYOTA Let's Go Places We are giving away 50 cars for free to celebrate our success! THE FACTS: A link circulating on social media sporting the Toyota logo that promises a free car in exchange for filling out a survey is a scam. The survey claims that the car company is giving away 50 Toyota C-HR Hybrid cars. Karen Nielsen, a Toyota spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that Toyota is aware of the false advertisement. The website claims there are 43 cars remaining. Once a user clicks on the ad, they are taken to a page with a large Toyota logo and the slogan ""Let's go places."" The ad tells users to fill out a survey and share the link with 20 people through What's App, a messaging platform. It then asks for the user to confirm their participation and enter address details.  Similar scams have cropped up on Facebook for Delta and Starbucks. ___ This is part of The Associated Press' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: https://www.apnews.com/tag/APFactCheck ___ Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",2638,2643,Auto Brand,421

Roughly 43,900 vehicles are included in Hyundai's recall. Toyota recalled roughly 64,900 Tundras and Sequoias, saying these vehicles are at risk for having their electronic stability control systems shutting down unexpectedly.

1048,"NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices and energy companies rallied Friday after OPEC said it will produce more oil, but not as much as investors feared. While trade tensions remained in the headlines, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher at the end of a bumpy week. U.S. crude futures jumped 4.6 percent after OPEC nations agreed to produce about 1 million additional barrels of oil per day. Reports have said for weeks that production was likely to rise, but analysts said investors appear to think the boost will be smaller than OPEC says it will. So oil prices rallied even though they usually go down when production rises. ""People were pricing crude in the last couple of weeks (expecting) a bigger increase by OPEC than what they agreed to,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group. The European Union followed through on its promise to put import taxes on $3.4 billion in U.S. goods including bourbon, peanut butter and orange juice in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Automakers were jolted after President Donald Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tax on cars imported from Europe, although none of them took big losses. The S&P 500 index rose as much as 14 points but ended with a gain of just 5.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,754.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 119.19 points, or 0.5 percent, to 24,580.89 to break an eight-day losing streak. The Dow lost 2 percent this week, with Boeing off 5.3 percent and Caterpillar down 6.7 percent. That was both companies' biggest loss in three months. Makers of chemicals and other basic materials like 3M also lost ground this week and technology companies slipped. The Nasdaq composite fell 20.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,692.82. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 3.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,685.58. U.S. crude climbed 4.6 percent to $68.58 a barrel in New York. That was its biggest one-day gain since November 2016, when OPEC and a group of other countries including Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day. Prices have been rising since then, and U.S. crude hit a three-year high of about $72 a barrel in May. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 3.4 percent to $75.55 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil picked up 2.1 percent to $81.38 and Marathon Oil surged 7.8 percent to $21.48. The European Union is enforcing tariffs on $3.4 billion in U.S. products in retaliation for duties the Trump administration has put on European steel and aluminum. The taxes are on American products including bourbon, peanut butter and orange juice, and the choices appear designed to create political pressure on Trump and senior U.S. politicians. EU authorities had said the move was coming in response to the U.S. import duties. On Twitter, Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tax on cars imported from the EU if barriers to trade are not removed soon. He previously ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to look into possible tariffs or quotas on imported cars and car parts. That jolted car companies. In Germany, shares of BMW lost 1.1 percent and Daimler sank 0.3 percent. Daimler fell more than 4 percent Thursday after it said Chinese tariffs on U.S. cars would contribute to a decline in its earnings this year. Ford and Toyota also dipped while Peugeot and General Motors rose. ""If you're in the direct line of fire from a tariff, it's hugely important,"" said Paulsen. Still, he said investors are very skeptical that a damaging trade war will break out. ""The trade war has heated up over the last couple of months and yet stocks are up over that period of time,"" he said. That was also the case Friday. Health care and household goods companies also rose while technology companies and banks fell. Open source software maker Red Hat dropped 12.4 percent to $142.14 after it cut its sales forecasts due to the strengthening dollar. Other technology companies also declined. The industry has been leading the market for more than a year, but it makes more of its sales outside the U.S. than any other major S&P 500 sector. Micron Technology fell 3.9 percent to $57.10 and Nvidia lost 2.4 percent to $250.95. In other commodity trading, wholesale gasoline jumped 2.9 percent to $2.07 a gallon.

1072,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford, with a sagging U.S. market share and one of the oldest vehicle lineups in the industry, is promising to revamp three-quarters of its models in the next two years. Much of the emphasis will be on refreshing or revamping the entire lineup of SUVs while adding gas-electric hybrid powertrains, two new off-road SUVs and two new trucks. It's all part of the larger plan to prepare the company for the future by cutting costs, increasing the number of common parts and feeding a long-starved product lineup. The move, detailed at a presentation on Thursday at Ford's product development center in Dearborn, Michigan, comes at a time when Ford's aging lineup has had trouble appealing to U.S. customers. In the past five years the company's market share has fallen over 2 percentage points to 14.4 percent so far this year. Last year its market share rose 0.1 percentage point. ""I have a reinvigorated view of the future,"" said Richard Bazzy, who runs a Ford dealership in Pittsburgh's northern suburbs and is among dealers who have been critical of company management. ""We've been waiting for a long time. We weren't sure what we were waiting for. Now we know."" Included in the hybrid plan is one for the F-150 pickup, the top-selling vehicle in America, that will offer increased towing power and an on-board generator. Ford pledged to be the hybrid sales leader, unseating Toyota in the U.S. by 2021. The new products, including complete revamps of the Explorer big SUV and Escape compact SUV, should help dealers who have struggled against competitors with fresher vehicles. Ford concedes its model lineup is among the industry's oldest, with an average age of 5.7 years. It promised to drop that to 3.3 years by 2020. The Escape small SUV hasn't been completely redone since 2012, while the Explorer was last all-new in 2011, both long cycles compared with competitors. Among the new product announcements: — The two off-road vehicles designed to compete with Jeep and Land Rover will be the new Bronco midsize SUV and a yet-to-be named small sport utility. — A new all-electric SUV with 300 miles of range between charges by 2020. Six more battery electric vehicles by 2022. — Standard safety features across nearly all models by 2020 including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and backup cameras. — Internet connectivity on all vehicles by the end of next year, enabling over-the-air software updates by 2020. CEO Jim Hackett, who is approaching one year on the job, said having hybrids in high-volume SUVs will aid performance and help the company and its customers hedge against the possibility of rising fuel prices. He also promised to speed up new product development in the future. Ford showed off some of the new vehicles but reporters had to promise not to describe or photograph them. There were no compact cars shown, but Ford says cars are still important. Ford shares rose 5 cents Thursday to close at $11.07. They are down 9.2 percent so far this year.",1399,1404,Auto Brand,425
1090,"If you're in the market for a new SUV, it's important to know not only what's available now but also what's coming. Here are six SUVs going on sale in the next several months that we at Edmunds think are worth waiting for. Why these six? One thing they have in common is the latest technology. On top of updated infotainment systems, every vehicle on this list offers a full suite of advanced safety features. Some have a few more tricks up their sleeves, and all offer something unique in the hopes of winning your hard-earned dollar. VOLVO XC40 Volvo's newest SUV is the subcompact 2019 XC40. It offers plenty of safety and technology features, and it's been built to make the most of its available space. Some useful highlights include an integrated trash bin, a hook for holding takeout food, and door pockets that can fit a 15-inch laptop. Acceleration comes from a punchy 248-horsepower turbocharged engine. And a hybrid model is coming. Volvo is also using the XC40 to pioneer its new subscription-based Care By Volvo service. Similar to a pay-as-you-go phone plan, consumers pay a fixed monthly fee to get the XC40 with nearly everything covered, including insurance, and the option to change to another vehicle in as little as one year. The XC40 Momentum — the only trim available at launch — comes with a price tag of $35,200. Future base pricing starts at $33,200. HYUNDAI SANTA FE AND SANTA FE XL We have high hopes for the redesigned 2019 Santa Fe. The lineup includes a two-row compact SUV and the larger three-row Santa Fe XL. Both look modern and upscale inside and out and should be very competitive with SUVs from Honda and Toyota. Three engines will be available, including a 232-horsepower turbocharged gas engine and a 200-horsepower turbodiesel. The latter, along with optional load-leveling suspension, should make the Santa Fe a capable tow vehicle. The Santa Fe also offers a new Safe Exit Assist feature that can lock a door if it senses a passenger is about to swing it open in the path of an oncoming vehicle. Pricing on either SUV is not yet available. The Santa Fe Sport currently goes for about $25,000 while the Santa Fe is $31,000. ACURA RDX The newest generation of Acura's compact luxury SUV looks to be its biggest step forward. The 2019 RDX will feature Acura's agility-enhancing all-wheel-drive system, a new look, lots of interior storage space and a nicely appointed cabin. Acura has also replaced the RDX's dual-screen infotainment setup, which was clunky and outdated. The new system uses a clean, high-definition screen and a touchpad controller. Further equipped with luxury features, such as a panoramic sunroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a head-up display and a premium audio system, the RDX should be one of the best new Acuras in years. No pricing information is available for the newest Acura RDX, but the current generation starts at $36,000. SUBARU ASCENT Those in need of a capable family hauler will have a new choice to consider: the 2019 Ascent. Subaru's three-row SUV is packed with features to keep both driver and passengers happy. With up to eight USB ports available, the Ascent can keep everyone's devices charged. Three-zone climate control and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are all standard, as are traffic-adaptive cruise control and a frontal collision mitigation system. With a $31,995 base price, the Ascent can also be optioned with lots of luxury-oriented comforts, including cooled front seats, second-row sunshades, and a premium Harman Kardon sound system. With 260 horsepower, standard all-wheel drive and a 5,000-pound towing capacity, the Ascent should make a compelling midsize choice. LEXUS UX Another new subcompact luxury SUV, the 2019 Lexus UX takes a different approach to the segment with its overstated, aggressive styling. Inside, you'll find a sleek design reminiscent of Lexus' flagship LC 500 coupe, as well as a digital gauge cluster. Both a 168-horsepower gasoline engine and a 176-horsepower hybrid with all-wheel drive will be available. The UX is a high-tech little SUV. It can use GPS information to adjust the vehicle to road conditions and maximize fuel efficiency. And it can be outfitted with an adaptive suspension to enhance ride comfort and handling precision. Pricing is not yet available. JAGUAR I-PACE If you wanted an all-electric SUV, your only choice up until now was the Tesla Model X. But Jaguar will give you another option with its 2019 I-Pace. The I-Pace should provide about 240 miles of driving range on a fully charged battery and yield a sports-car-worthy 0-60 mph sprint of about 4.5 seconds. The I-Pace doesn't offer a lot of cargo space, but it comes with a luxuriously appointed interior and a sleek-looking tech interface. Before incentives, the I-Pace should come in around $70,000, which also makes its price tag smaller than the Model X's. EDMUNDS SAYS: Though there's no shortage of good SUVs available now, it's worth taking note of new models hitting dealer showrooms this summer and fall. One could end up suiting your needs the best. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds. Will Kaufman is an associate staff writer at Edmunds.

1093,"In a story distributed by The Associated Press on July 18 about recommended vehicles for towing small trailers, Edmunds reported erroneously the engine that's available on the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox. The optional engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, not a 3.6-liter V6. A corrected version of the story is below: Pulling their weight: 8 vehicles for towing small trailers Edmunds recommends 8 vehicles that have the towing power you'd need for small trailers By TRAVIS LANGNESS Edmunds Going small is big these days. Just scroll through all the tiny-house shows on cable and you'll see how popular minimalism is. It's also popular for trailers. Pulling up to a parking spot and having a comfortable, enclosed bed to sleep in is ideal for lots of travelers — especially if they're using small, lightweight trailers that don't require a full-size SUV or a heavy-duty pickup truck to pull them along. There are lots of small trailers now available in the 800- to 4,000-pound range. Dub Box offers several trailers under 1,000 pounds, while the Happier Camper HC1 starts at around 1,100 pounds. Even Airstream has gotten into the small-camper market with the 3,400-pound Nest trailer. Using a small, lightweight trailer opens up a surprisingly wide variety of vehicles that can tow them. With that in mind, here's a list of some of our favorite cars and crossovers that can take you and your little rig to the campground in style. It should be noted that while we list the maximum towing capacity of these vehicles, it's actually best to avoid towing at the maximum capacity — doing so taxes braking and acceleration — and be familiar with the vehicle's gross combined weight rating. But if you pick the right car-and-trailer combo, you'll be on the small-is-beautiful path toward your getaway. 2018 CHEVROLET EQUINOX If you're looking for a well-rounded crossover, the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox is a smart choice. It comes standard with a long list of tech and creature comforts and is available with three different engines. With the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the Equinox can tow just as much as the Odyssey or the RAV4 — 3,500 pounds — making it plenty capable enough for our purposes. Also, the 2019 Chevrolet Equinox is starting to show up at dealerships. 2018 FORD ESCAPE The 2018 Ford Escape is a sporty and attractive crossover that drives well on curvy roads and is available with Ford's easy-to-use Sync technology. Those are just a few reasons to consider the Escape for your outdoor excursion, and the maximum towing capacity of 3,500 pounds is the perfect icing on the cake. 2018 HONDA ODYSSEY In the ultra-practical minivan world, the 2018 Honda Odyssey is our favorite. It's spacious and packed with family-friendly features such as a rear-seat monitor and an integrated vacuum cleaner. The Odyssey is also capable of towing up to 3,500 pounds when you select the Touring or Elite trim and opt for the towing package. It's proof that you don't need to get a big SUV to have plenty of room for your brood and enough power to tow a decent-size small trailer. 2018 JEEP RENEGADE While it's got the lowest tow rating on our list, the 2018 Jeep Renegade is still capable of towing as much as 2,000 pounds with the optional 2.4-liter engine. That should be enough for a lightweight trailer. The Renegade's small footprint also allows it to be nimble and agile in town, and it has one of the smoother rides you'll find in the subcompact crossover SUV class. 2018 PORSCHE MACAN Got more money to spend but still want something small and maneuverable? Check out the 2018 Porsche Macan. With a maximum tow rating of 4,409 pounds, there are few smaller trailers that this Porsche SUV can't handle. The Macan's well-built interior and engaging driving dynamics help it pull ahead of the competition. 2018 SUBARU OUTBACK With a reputation for being rugged and capable off-road, the 2018 Subaru Outback will fit in at any campsite. Hook up a trailer and you'll feel even more legit. The Outback has a roomy, comfortable interior and lots of modern features. It's also capable of towing 2,700 pounds with the optional six-cylinder engine. Pair that with Subaru's standard all-wheel-drive system and you've got a crossover that's tailor-made for a getaway. 2018 TOYOTA RAV4 The 2018 Toyota RAV4 covers all the bases. It's a good family hauler thanks to its spacious interior and smooth ride. But what you might not expect is that it's above par when it comes to towing. With the optional Tow Prep package, you get some additional engine-cooling hardware and a maximum tow rating of 3,500 pounds. 2018 VOLVO S60 If you don't like the idea of a hatchback or a crossover, there's the 2018 Volvo S60. It has a maximum towing capacity of 3,500 pounds, which is on par with most of the crossovers on our list, and it's a relatively plush sedan. Once you've dropped your trailer off at the campsite, the S60 drives well, too. EDMUNDS SAYS: Full-size SUVs and pickup trucks are massively capable, but there are a lot of cars and crossovers that can tow, too. Take a closer look at the towing capacity of some smaller vehicles; you might not have to get a big rig to pull your small, lightweight trailer. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1099,"TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. chief Akio Toyoda, tapped to head the Japanese auto industry association, promised Friday to lead a push among manufacturers to keep a competitive edge in emerging technologies such as zero-emission and autonomous driving. Japanese companies are among the world's top automakers, but some are worried whether they can maintain that lead amid major technological shifts that allow the entry of newcomers, including those outside the auto sector. Toyoda, the new chairman of the 14-member Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association, acknowledged that new competitors have plentiful cash and tend to be quick. He did not give examples, but among such big names are Google Inc., with its Waymo self-driving car spinoff, and ride-hailing service Uber. ""Whether we can stay competitive is an important challenge for Japanese automakers,"" he told reporters, adding that he views the new technologies as opportunities. ""Japan is not falling behind."" Toyoda said Japan leads the world in ""electrified vehicles,"" including hybrids and plug-ins with pure electric vehicles, and isn't lagging behind China, more widely associated with the electric-car drive. Although China has far more electric cars on its roads than does Japan, hybrid vehicles are extremely popular in Japan. Toyota, which recently reported record profits for the fiscal year through March, makes the world's best-selling hybrid, the Prius. Hybrids have gasoline engines in addition to electric motors, and aren't zero-emission. Toyoda, the grandson of Toyota's founder, is the first to lead the industry group twice, having served from 2012 to 2014. The group includes truck makers such as Mitsubishi Fuso and second-tier Mazda Motor Corp., as well as Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. Toyoda said the high cost of car ownership in Japan, including taxes, parking and insurance, must come down to reverse the longtime decline in the domestic market. He hopes to be a kind of cheerleader for the industry, referring to his nickname Morizo, which he uses for his blog and car-racing events. ""I'm not boasting or anything, but I want to fully leverage that iconic image I have earned as a true car lover,"" he said. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at Her work can be found at",13,18,Auto Brand,428
1108,"WALL STREET Stocks gain as banks surge higher NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are rising as banks jump. Major indexes are on track to close out the second quarter with small gains. The Federal Reserve said most of the largest U.S. banks can buy back more stock and raise their dividends. Wells Fargo, which announced a $24.5 billion stock repurchase, jumped 5.7 percent and Citigroup rose 2.1 percent. Athletic apparel maker Nike jumped 11.6 percent after it said North American sales improved. It will also buy back $15 billion in stock. CONSUMER SPENDING US consumer spending grew just 0.2 percent in May WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S consumers increased their spending just 0.2 percent in May, a disappointing result after two months of much stronger gains. The weaker reading could raise questions about the extent of economic growth overall in the current April-June quarter. The Commerce Department says that the tiny rise in spending last month followed much stronger increases of 0.6 percent in March and 0.5 percent in April. It was the poorest showing since spending had fallen 0.1 percent in February. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, and economists are counting on solid gains to propel economic growth after a slow start to the year. In a more hopeful sign, incomes grew a solid 0.4 percent in May, supported by strong growth in wages and salaries. TRUMP-TAX CUTS Trump touts tax cuts during successful week WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he ""unleashed an economic miracle"" with his tax cuts last year. Trump spoke Friday at a White House event marking the six-month anniversary of the $1.5 trillion tax cuts. The cuts are taking effect in the ninth year of an economic expansion that began under former President Barack Obama. Trump called the cuts the ""biggest"" in history. The overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s and post-World War II tax cuts. The law provides generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and more modest reductions for middle- and low-income individuals and families. Trump has been enjoying a good week, with two favorable Supreme Court rulings and Justice Anthony Kennedy's plans to retire from the Supreme Court. TRADE-TRUMP-AUTO-TARIFFS Automakers, manufacturers oppose Trump call for auto tariffs WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign automakers, American manufacturers and classic-car enthusiasts are coming out against President Donald Trump's plan to consider taxing imported cars, trucks and auto parts. The National Association of Manufacturers says in a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department that the tariff plan would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States."" Toyota Motor North America says the tariffs ""would have a negative impact on all manufacturers, increasing the cost of imported vehicles as well as domestically produced vehicles that rely on imported parts"" — such as the company's Kentucky-built Camry. Friday is the deadline for public comments on Trump's call for a Commerce investigation into whether auto imports pose enough of a threat to U.S. national security to justify tariffs. JAPAN-US-AUTOS Japan to US: Auto tariff would damage US, world economy TOKYO (AP) — Japan's government has warned in a report that a higher U.S. tariff on auto imports could backfire, jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of American jobs created by Japanese auto-related companies, raising prices for U.S. consumers and devastating the U.S. and global economy. Japan's trade ministry said it submitted the report Friday to the U.S. Department of Commerce. In May, Trump ordered the department to conduct an investigation to determine if higher tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and auto parts were justified on national security grounds. The move outraged Japanese automakers, which have invested billions of dollars in U.S. plants that employ tens of thousands of workers. Japan has told the World Trade Organization it may levy retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods totaling about $450 million a year. CITIGROUP-CREDIT CARDS Citigroup to refund $335 million to credit card customers NEW YORK (AP) — Citigroup is agreeing to refund $335 million to a group of customers who may have been overpaying interest on their credit cards. In a settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Citi will refund 1.75 million customers in overpaid interest by year-end. Earlier this year, Citi disclosed that it had used a flawed methodology in determining whether credit card customers were eligible for an interest rate reduction on their cards, as required by the CARD Act, a federal law that governs the credit card industry. Citi disclosed the flaw to regulators, including the CFPB, in 2017. The CFPB chose not to fine Citi for the flawed practice, citing the bank's choice to self-report the problem to regulators and was in the process of refunding customers. PUERTO RICO-ECONOMIC CRISIS Board announces new austerity measures for Puerto Rico SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — New austerity measures are looming for storm-battered Puerto Rico after legislators refused to change labor laws as ordered by a federal control board overseeing the U.S. territory's finances amid an 11-year recession. The board said Friday that it will eliminate a $25 million scholarship fund for the island's largest public university, as well as a $50 million annual fund for municipalities. In addition, the board said it will scrap an annual Christmas bonus for all government employees starting next fiscal year. Gov. Ricardo Rossello did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The board also said it would implement its own budget for Puerto Rico if legislators do not submit a proposal by Saturday that is consistent with a recently approved fiscal plan.

Campbell Soup plunged after lowering its profit forecast and announcing that its CEO, Denise Morrison, was retiring effective immediately.  Nordstrom tumbled after the upscale department store chain said sales at established stores, a key metric for retailers, showed meager gains in the first quarter. After a strong start to the month, markets have been choppy this week as investors turned the page on the first-quarter earnings reporting season and weighed the implications of rising interest rates and the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. FARM BILL House defeats farm bill as conservatives revolt WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservatives rebuffed on immigration have sunk a bill that combined stricter work and job training requirements for food stamp recipients with a renewal of farm subsidies popular in Republican-leaning farm country. The 213-198 vote is an embarrassing blow to House GOP leaders, who had hoped to tout its new work requirements for recipients of food stamps. The work initiative polls well with voters, especially those in the GOP political base. Key conservatives in the rebellious House Freedom Caucus opposed the measure, seeking leverage to obtain a vote on a hard-line immigration plan. Negotiations with GOP leaders Friday morning failed to bear fruit, however, and the measure was defeated. House Speaker Paul Ryan took steps to call for a revote in the future but it's not clear when the measure might be revived. CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA-BANKRUPTCY Cambridge Analytica to liquidate NEW YORK (AP) — Jennifer and Rebekah Mercer, daughters of Republican mega-donor Robert Mercer, are liquidating Cambridge Analytica. The Mercer sisters are majority shareholders of the troubled data collection agency that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign and caused a global Facebook privacy scandal in recent months. Cambridge Analytica has insisted that none of the Facebook data it acquired from an academic researcher was used in the Trump campaign. The company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. Facebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions. The British firm filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection late Thursday in New York. Earlier this month it filed papers to begin insolvency proceedings in the U.K., blaming ""unfairly negative media coverage.""

Denise Morrison, who has been has been CEO since 2011, is being replaced immediately by board member Keith McLoughlin, who will lead the company on an interim basis. The New Jersey food company posted a third-quarter loss of $393 million on Friday and lowered its earnings projections for the year, due in part to the acquisition of the snack company Snyder's-Lance Inc. Campbell's is wrestling with declining soup and juice sales in a market crowded with competitors, at the same time that many families are seeking foods they consider healthier and less processed. The company, founded almost 150 years ago, is also facing new headwinds due to recent changes in U.S. trade policy.

The Federal Motor Transport Authority said Friday that it discussed ""impermissible defeat devices"" that led to increased emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides. The mandatory recall covers 6,755 4.2 liter V8 diesels in the European Union for the Cayenne from the 2015 and 2016 model years. Also included are 52,831 3.0 liter V6 diesels for the Macan model.

John Kelsey Gammell earlier pleaded guilty to federal hacking conspiracy charges. The FBI says the case represents a growing form of cybercrime in which professional hackers are paid to inflict damage on individuals, businesses and others who rely on digital devices. Gammell admitted in federal court in St. Paul to engaging in a campaign of cyberattacks against at least three dozen websites between 2015 and 2017, including those of former employers, banks, Hennepin County in Minnesota and the Minnesota Judicial Branch. Gammell's sentence Thursday also included charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. THEME PARK ATTENDANCE New attractions in Orlando power jump in park attendance ORLANDO, Fla.

The Orlando market represents about a third of theme park attendance in North America, according to the report released this week by the Themed Entertainment Association. Growth was even bigger around the globe. The top 10 biggest theme parks worldwide saw an 8.6 percent attendance increase. The Orlando theme park companies typically don't release attendance figures.

But there are plenty of other vehicles at the show, which is one of the industry's largest. Mercedes and BMW have new SUVs, while several Japanese automakers are showing off prototypes of future vehicles. It's all happening in a U.S. auto market that's shrinking but still expected to remain at healthy levels. Last year sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million, still near record highs. Analysts expect sales to be just under 17 million in 2018. AUTO SHOW-CHINA IS COMING China's GAC to scrap Trump-sounding brand for US market DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automaker GAC Motor will scrap the brand name it uses in China when it enters the U.S. market next year because it could be confused with President Donald Trump's surname. For the past eight years, GAC has sold cars and SUVs under the brand Trumpchi in its home market, but is now researching new names before the company's expected U.S. debut in the fourth quarter of 2019. Wang Qiujing, president of GAC Engineering Institute China, said through an interpreter in an interview at the Detroit auto show that GAC picked the Chinese name Trumpchi in 2010, well before Trump was elected. Hee says the similarity to Trump is just a coincidence. GAC will continue to use Trumpchi in China, where the word means legend and good fortune. GAC's first vehicle in the U.S. will be the GS8, a loaded-out full-size SUV that will cost about $35,000. Two more vehicles are being researched for U.S. sales, but have not been selected yet. TRUMP-PANAMA FIGHT Panama Hotel votes to drop Trump — but his company won't go WASHINGTON (AP) — An attempt to oust President Donald Trump's hotel business from managing a luxury hotel in Panama has turned bitter, with accusations of financial misconduct. Trump Hotels is contesting its firing, and its staff ran off a team of Marriott executives invited last month to visit the property during a search for a new hotel operator, according to two people familiar with the matter. After the owners' association accused Trump Hotels of mismanagement and financial misconduct in a $15 million arbitration claim, the company owned by the president fired back with a $200 million counterclaim and refused to turn over the property's financial records. When a team from Marriott International Inc. came to the property at the invitation of the hotel's majority owner, Trump staff asked them to leave, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what happened behind the scenes. The two people say the head of Trump Hotels, Eric Danziger, also called Marriott chief executive Arne Sorenson to complain about the visit. Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten said the call was not intended to pressure Marriott. A spokeswoman for Marriott declined to comment.

1164,"DETROIT (AP) — The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opened to the press this week with one big question hanging in the air: How will autonomous vehicles change the industry? The answer is still unclear. In the meantime, automakers continue to put out new vehicles of all shapes and sizes, including small cars, SUVs and the all-mighty pickup truck, which dominated the show. All will be on display when the show opens to the public Saturday, with a charity preview on Friday night. Here are five things we learned from the preview this week: TRUCKS ARE KING Pickups are the most popular vehicles in the U.S., and trucks unveiled at the show make clear that will continue for a long time. General Motors spent heavily to update its top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup, cutting up to 450 pounds of weight by using more aluminum and lighter high-strength steel. The truck also gets two new V8 engines that can run on one to eight cylinders depending on how much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler's Ram also got big updates, losing more than 200 pounds and giving it a gas-electric hybrid engine option. Both the Silverado and Ram were given more athletic stances and meaner looks. Ford added a diesel engine to its F-150 and rolled out the midsize Ranger. Automakers turn big profits on large pickups. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. Ford's F-Series is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the Silverado and Ram. TAX REFORM BOOST? U.S. auto sales are likely to fall to around 16.7 million in 2018 from 17.2 million last year, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. But that would still make it one of the 10 best sales years in history, so the market remains strong. U.S. income tax code changes this year may stimulate new auto sales, but any increase likely will be offset by rising interest rates and the abundant supply of late-model used cars that pull buyers from new vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp.'s top North American executive says. North American CEO Jim Lentz expects a sales boost of 200,000 vehicles as tax cuts put more money in people's pockets. But the increase could be negated as rising rates keep some people on the sidelines, and some buyers opt for a lower-cost but nice off-lease used car. Tax cuts could boost pickup truck sales because businesses can write off the expenses immediately under the new code, Lentz said. But he expects luxury new-car sales to be flat this year even though tax rates were reduced for higher-income earners. Any decrease could be wiped out by caps on deductions for mortgage interest and local and state taxes in big luxury-car states such as New York and California, Lentz said. TRADE DEAL Many auto executives interviewed at the auto show say they're afraid the U.S. might pull out of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, but they can't prepare for it because they don't know what, if anything will replace it. In ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada, the Trump administration is seeking to ensure that more vehicles are made in America, among other changes. But Jim Lentz, Toyota's North American CEO, says ending the agreement would likely raise costs. That, in turn, would raise vehicle prices and cut demand, forcing manufacturing layoffs. It also would make the U.S. less competitive than the world's other manufacturing centers, he said. Ending the agreement also could force some suppliers to stop making parts. Charlie Chesbrough, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, said it's hard to imagine there will be much change in production, because automakers need a long lead time to act and they know the next president could reverse Trump's actions. But some automakers are already taking pre-emptive steps to show the administration they're willing to boost U.S. production. Fiat Chrysler said ahead of the auto show that it will move heavy duty truck production from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. HEDGING ON ROBOT CARS Automakers are hedging their bets when it comes to autonomous vehicles and whether they will someday cut into or even end personal car ownership. In interviews through the week, executives said they're preparing for a time when people hire self-driving ride services to get around instead of spending on personal vehicles. But they don't know just when that will take place, so they also must continue to spend millions to develop conventional vehicles as well. ""These proclamations that we hear about the advent of electrification and artificial intelligence ... are all things that, at best, are conjecture,"" said Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Although some companies plan to deploy driverless cars to carry passengers in coming months, Marchionne says it will take years for the vehicles to be in widespread use. Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development says he wishes he knew exactly when and where the switch would take place. But for now, GM and other companies have to be in both places. ""We can go either way and that agility is priceless,"" said Reuss. GOOD OLD DAYS Despite the new wheels on the show floor, one of the biggest hits is a 50-year-old Mustang GT fastback in need of a paint job. It was one of the original cars used in the 1968 film ""Bullitt,"" which put the Mustang on the map with a famous chase scene. Ford Motor Co. rolled it out to help celebrate a special ""Bullitt"" edition Mustang, which goes on sale this summer.

1219,"DETROIT (AP) — Japanese vehicle brands are exploring new design ideas — and figuring out what sets them apart from their U.S. and European rivals — with new prototype vehicles. Nissan, Infiniti and Lexus are all unveiling new concept cars at the Detroit auto show, which opens to the public Saturday. Concepts are used to test ideas and see how show visitors react. Some elements are glamorous but impractical, with sharply angled headlights or pencil-thin side mirrors that will never actually end up on a production vehicle. But other elements from concept cars do make it onto the road. Lexus's gaping spindle grilles, now a feature on the automaker's vehicles, were introduced in 2011 on the LF-Gh concept car. ""Maybe they don't develop that concept per se, but it makes a statement about where the brand is going,"" says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. This year's auto show concepts differ in many ways, but they're striving for one thing: simplicity. They all have serene interiors with real wood and minimal distractions. Karim Habib, Infiniti's executive design director, says designers are reacting to all the visual stimulation in the world. ""It is our intention to be an antidote to that,"" he said. Here are some details on the concept cars at the show: INFINITI Q INSPIRATION: The sleek sedan from Nissan Motor Co.'s luxury Infiniti brand explores how design will change as it moves to compact but powerful variable compression ratio engines. Karim Habib, Infiniti's executive design director, said the smaller engine allows for a shorter hood and a bigger passenger cabin than Infiniti's previous models. The exterior is bold and deceptively simple; there are few lines, but they're deeply etched into the surface so the curves shift as the viewer moves around the vehicle. At first glance, it's hard to see the grille, which is made of twisted metal painted the same color as the car. Inside, there are subtle details, like the traditional Japanese fabric made with gold rice paper that's tucked under the door handles. Each passenger has a touchscreen that offers guided meditation to reduce stress. Habib says the interior is meant to reflect Japan's tradition of polite, generous hospitality. Habib says elements from the Q Inspiration will eventually make it into production vehicles. LEXUS LF-1 LIMITLESS: Vehicle brands have always had so-called flagship sedans, the big cars in the lineup that set the tone for all the others. Lexus, which invented the luxury crossover 20 years ago with the RX 300, is now playing with the idea of a flagship crossover SUV. The LF-1 is built so it can be powered by a fuel cell, a hybrid system, gasoline or a battery. By 2025, Lexus says, all of its models will have one of those options available. The LF-1 was designed in California but took its inspiration from a traditional Japanese sword, imagining smooth molten metal flowing into a solid, chiseled form. Inside, knobs and buttons are replaced by motion-activated controls and a wide, unobstructed dashboard. Lexus General Manager Jeff Bracken says Toyota Motor Corp.'s luxury Lexus brand will decide whether to build a flagship crossover based on customer and dealer response to the concept. NISSAN XMOTION: Nissan Motor Co.'s XMotion — pronounced ""cross motion"" — differs from the Infiniti and Lexus concepts in exterior styling; instead of spare, undulating designs, the Xmotion is solid, square and blocky. It's ready for rugged use, with all-terrain tires and a retractable rooftop cargo box. But Alfonso Albaisa, Nissan's global design director, said the tough exterior protects the soft, cocoon-like interior. The long center console, which runs from the front to the rear seats, is made of cedar and uses a traditional Japanese architectural wood joinery technique. Cedar is also used for slats below the dashboard, which are meant to convey the sturdy ""bones"" of the vehicle. Nissan says the XMotion will serve as a blueprint for the company's SUVs and eventual autonomous shared vehicles.",3108,3113,Auto Brand,436
1248,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — Starting next month, Nissan Motor Co. is testing on regular roads what it calls ""a robo-vehicle mobility service."" Called Easy Ride, it uses a cell-phone app to book semi-autonomous driven rides. But Easy Ride won't necessarily be easy if poor internet connections mean it won't work at all. Nissan says that feedback from the 300 people who have signed up to try out Easy Ride will be used to fine-tune the app. The Japanese automaker hopes to roll it out as a commercial service in the early 2020s. Details, including pricing, are undecided. The service was developed in a partnership, which began last year, with Japanese mobile game provider DeNA Co. DeNA has been working on driverless bus and delivery services in Japan. For now, Easy Ride will be limited to a 4.5-kilometer (2.8-mile) course that starts from Nissan headquarters and winds through a shopping mall area in this Japanese port city. The app is only in Japanese, but there are plans to offer it in several languages for tourists and other travelers. Like other autonomous drive technology, the Easy Ride vehicle is packed with cameras, sensors and radars to recognize pedestrians, intersections, traffic lights and other vehicles. It's still only driverless in principle, though, since Japanese law doesn't allow totally driverless vehicles. So a human driver in a no-hands position sits behind the steering wheel. The system isn't flawless, with human intervention sometimes needed to avoid a crash, according to Nissan. It's just one of several such kinds of technology being worked on around the world, such as Google's Waymo and Tesla's Autopilot. Just about all the major automakers, including Mercedes and Toyota, are working on such technologies. Nissan has been among the most aggressive. Although opinion is divided on the projection that as many as 10 million driverless cars will be on roads by 2020, everyone agrees the technology is going to grow. ""I think the potential is quite large in the long term, especially in large cities such as Tokyo or Boston, where there is a need for point-to-point transit but little incentive to own cars,"" said Nicholas Evans, an assistant professor at UMass Lowell. However, he cautioned, ""In introducing technology, all it takes is for a couple of high-profile accidents for consumers to turn against manufacturers. ""It's in the self-interest of manufacturers for rigorous testing and public input on this new kind of technology,"" said Evans, who studies the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies such as drones and self-driving vehicles. For Easy Ride, users first download a special app on their cellphones. After logging on, voice recognition is used to set a destination, and the date and time for when the ride picks you up at one of four possible spots in Yokohama. Once in the back seat of the vehicle, a display shows your route on a digital map. It also recommends events such as concerts, historical landmarks, restaurants and other places to visit, which pop up as photos and text on the display. The service also includes coupons that can be downloaded and used at those spots. Easy Ride is still experimental, but future uses Nissan envisions include parents using it to pick up their children and tourists using it to easily find their way around. Some glitches remain. In a recent demonstration for reporters, the app had problems launching because of a poor net connection at Nissan headquarters. When a reporter said, ""I want to eat a burger,"" it successfully recommended several nearby joints. But it was not able to find the nearest New Balance store, or any other place to buy sneakers. ____ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",1704,1709,Auto Brand,437

That followed pledges to buy more U.S. goods and end restrictions on foreign ownership in the industry. Ford Motor Co. responded by announcing a cut in prices of imported models. But industry analysts say automakers including Ford, General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG are likely to gain little in sales, because most of their vehicles sold in China are produced in local factories.

1268,"Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has delivered on its CEO's promise to build a lower-priced car at a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of June. CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to company employees Sunday praising them for producing 5,000 Model 3s, a compact car that's designed to shift Tesla from a niche manufacturer to a mainstream automaker. Musk also said the company had cranked out a combined 2,000 of Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles, bringing overall production to a record 7,000 for the week. ""We did it!"" Musk wrote. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team."" The e-mail was reported by the website Electrek, and the company confirmed its authenticity. Last summer, when the first Model 3s began rolling off the assembly line, Musk promised to build 5,000 per week by December and 10,000 per week in 2018. But he also warned at the time that Tesla was entering at least six months of ""manufacturing hell"" as it tried to hit the targets. Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at the market research firm AutoPacific Inc., wasn't impressed. ""Reaching it is one thing,"" Sullivan said. ""Consistently producing 5,000 per week with outstanding quality is another. I don't think producing 5,000 once is anything to get excited about until it's repeatable."" Model 3 sales are critical to Tesla's future. The company has never posted a full-year profit, and it burned through more than $1 billion in cash in the first quarter. Wall Street investors, who have pushed the company's stock beyond $340 per share, are growing impatient with the losses. Moody's Investor Service downgraded Tesla's debt into junk territory back in March, warning that Tesla won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla said cash from Model 3 sales will pay the bills and drive profits. The company reached 5,000 per week as Musk spent many nights inside the Fremont, California, factory that once belonged to a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota. To quickly put another assembly line in place, Tesla built a large tent at the factory site. Musk told investors on a first-quarter earnings conference call that the company relied too heavily on automation. It had to hire more people to work at the factory. Tesla said in April that it had about 450,000 orders for the Model 3. But some could be getting antsy, especially those who want a price closer to the base of $35,000. Currently Tesla is selling only Model 3s that cost $49,000 to in excess of $70,000. Many have been waiting since March of 2016, when Tesla began taking orders with a $1,000 refundable deposit. The company also may have to deal with some safety issues. Investigators from two federal agencies are looking into five crashes of its vehicles, some involving the semi-autonomous Autopilot system or post-crash battery fires that have been difficult to extinguish. But regardless of those issues, Musk was in a celebratory mood Sunday.

TRUMP-CONSUMER WATCHDOG Court rules in favor of Trump over fate of consumer watchdog NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge has ruled in favor of President Donald Trump and the White House over the control of a national financial watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Judge Timothy Kelly has issued an order denying Leandra English, the deputy director of the CFPB, a restraining order that would have stopped Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, from taking on a second role as acting director of the agency. The conflict arose late last month when Richard Cordray, named by President Barack Obama to lead the CFPB, stepped down and named English as his replacement. In response, the White House named Mulvaney as the replacement for Cordray. Kelly had expressed skepticism in hearings last month about whether English would prevail in her case. CANADA-US-TRADE COMPLAINT Canada launches trade complaint against US over duties OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canada has launched an attack on U.S. trade practices with an international complaint over Washington's use of punitive duties. The complaint ramps up tensions amid talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade agreement. Canada wants the World Trade Organization to examine the use of duties in the United States, alleging they violate international law. The complaint was filed last month but released Wednesday. The U.S. just announced duties of up to 9 percent on Canadian paper. It follows a series of similar penalties as the U.S. alleges unfair trade practices by Canada in the form of softwood lumber and Bombardier subsidies. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement that Canada's complaint is a ""broad and ill-advised attack on the U.S. trade remedies system."" UNITED STATES-NORWAY Trump says US-Norway ties 'robust' WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says the economic ties between the United States and Norway are ""robust and growing"" and he's pointing to their work in the NATO alliance to counter security threats. Trump is joining with Prime Minister Erna Solberg at a news conference following their meeting at the White House. Solberg is highlighting the two nation's deep roots and says she assured the president that Norway is an ally and a friend ""that you can count on."" Norway's leader says her country is committed to the Paris climate agreement and sees tremendous economic opportunities in the green economy. Trump announced last year his intention to pull the U.S. out of the climate pact. CHINA-NEW SILK ROAD HURDLES China's modern Silk Road hits political, financial hurdles BEIJING (AP) — China's plan for a modern Silk Road of railways, ports and other facilities linking Asia with Europe has hit a $14 billion pothole in Pakistan. Pakistan's relations with Beijing are so close that officials call China their ""Iron Brother."" Despite that, plans for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were thrown into turmoil in November when the chairman of Pakistan's water authority rejected what he said was a demand from Beijing for an ownership stake in the project. From Pakistan to Tanzania to Hungary, projects under President Xi Jinping's signature ""Belt and Road Initiative"" are being canceled, renegotiated or delayed due to disputes about costs or complaints host countries get too little out of projects built by Chinese companies and financed by loans from Beijing that must be repaid. BOOKS-FIRE AND FURY SALES 'Fire and Fury' sales top 29,000 in first weekend NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury"" was the top-selling book last week. And according to NPD BookScan, its numbers are likely to grow far higher. BookScan announced Wednesday that ""Fire and Fury"" sold 29,000 copies. But Wolff's explosive tell-all about the Trump administration only came out last Friday and BookScan's weekly sales run through Saturday. Kristen McLean, the NPD Group's book industry analyst, says ""The first couple of days of sales figures aren't giving us the full picture."" McLean noted that Hillary Clinton's ""What Happened,"" which came out last September, averaged sales of more than 30,000 hardcover copies per day in its opening week. But that book ""was hugely anticipated and very well stocked."" ""Fire and Fury"" seemed to catch everyone off guard, including Henry Holt and Co. The publisher has now raised an initial announced printing of 150,000 to more than 1 million. TOYOTA-NEW FACTORY Toyota-Mazda plant: Alabama bids to become a major auto hub MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama has entered the fast lane in its bid to become a major auto making hub in the South, landing a coveted $1.6 billion joint venture plant of Toyota and Mazda that is to eventually employ thousands. The new plant will be located in Huntsville, Alabama — already a hub for the region's aerospace industry — and will produce 300,000 vehicles per year, a combination of the Toyota Corolla compact car and a new small crossover SUV from Mazda. Production is expected to begin by 2021. Toyota and Mazda will join Mercedes, Honda and Hyundai which operate assembly plants in Alabama. The Center for Automotive Research says Alabama is tied with Tennessee as the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in the country last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research TRUMP-COAL PLANTS Coal baron's action plan became Trump policy initiatives WASHINGTON (AP) — In the early days of the Trump administration, the head of one of America's largest coal companies sent a four-page ""action plan"" to the White House calling for rollbacks of key environmental and mine safety regulations. Murray Energy chairman Robert ""Bob"" Murray claimed the rollbacks would help revive the struggling mining industry. A review by The Associated Press of that March 1 plan shows Murray, an early Trump campaign supporter, has gotten about half the items on his wish list. Still others, such as eliminating federal tax credits for wind turbines and solar panels, failed to win approval in Congress. Murray has spoken widely about his priorities, but a copy of the plan itself became public this week after it was obtained by Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rh",6475,6480,Auto Brand,443

Technology and health care companies are leading the gains. Industrial stocks are also rising following encouraging data on industrial production. Some big banks fell after reporting hefty quarterly losses. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.56 percent. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION US industrial production rose 0.9 percent in December WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve says U.S. industrial production rose 0.9 percent in December, pulled higher by a surge in utility output, another sign of health for the American economy. Utility production shot up 5.6 percent last month, the most since March 2017. Manufacturing output edged up 0.1 percent. Mining production rose 1.6 percent. American industry was running at 77.9 percent of capacity last month, the highest since February 2015. Overall industrial production — including manufacturing, mining and utilities — rose 3.6 percent over the past year. It was the best annual performance since 2010. Industrial production picked up at the end of 2017 after being held down by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The U.S. economy is looking healthy, with unemployment at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. BUILDER SENTIMENT US homebuilder sentiment slips; outlook remains positive UNDATED (AP) — U.S. homebuilders are feeling slightly less optimistic about their sales prospects, even as their overall outlook remains favorable. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday slipped this month to 72. That's down two points from December's reading, which marked the strongest level of optimism in more than 18 years. Readings above 50 indicate more builders see sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has remained above 60 since September 2016. The two-point January decline was anticipated by analysts surveyed by FactSet. Builders' view of current sales conditions, their outlook for sales over the next six months, and a measure of traffic by prospective buyers also fell. New home sales jumped 17.5 percent in November, the fastest pace in more than 25 years. FEDERAL RESERVE-NOMINATIONS Senate committee approves nomination of Powell for Fed chair WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Banking Committee has voted for a second time to approve President Donald Trump's nomination of Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. The approval Wednesday was by voice vote with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, asking to be recorded as voting no. The re-vote was needed because the full Senate did not take up Powell's nomination last year. The term of current Fed Chair Janet Yellen ends on Feb. 3. The committee also approved Fed board member Randal Quarles for a full 14-year term on the Fed board. He won approval last year for a shorter term. His nomination was also approved by voice vote, with Warren and Sens. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, voting no. DAVOS FORUM-GLOBAL RISKS Survey finds geopolitical, cyber threats key concerns in '18 GENEVA (AP) — The World Economic Forum says a new survey found more than nine in 10 experts are expressing concerns about worsening economic or political confrontation between world powers, as ""charismatic strongman politics"" increasingly affects geopolitics. The WEF, perhaps best known as the organizer of the annual Davos conference that convenes next week, cites a ""deteriorating geopolitical landscape"" as among factors behind a pessimistic outlook this year. It adds to lingering environmental worries and comes despite signs of an economic rebound. Its Global Risks Report released Wednesday includes a survey of nearly 1,000 experts and decision-makers about 30 global risks over a 10-year span. The team behind the report says geopolitical tensions are fanning an increase in the scale and sophistication of cyberattacks, and suggests greater investment in prevention is needed. EUROPEAN CAR SALES European car sales increase for 4th straight year MILAN (AP) — Car sales in Europe rose for the fourth straight year in 2017, topping 15 million units for the first time in a decade. The ACEA association of European carmakers said Wednesday that car sales rose by 3.4 percent last year, from 14.6 million in 2016. Italy and Spain tallied the strongest gains, nearing 8 percent, followed by France at nearly 5 percent and Germany at nearly 3 percent. But demand for new cars declined in Britain by nearly 6 percent on the heels of the vote to leave the European Union. Mass-market carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen expanded by a full 28 percent to over 1.8 million vehicles. Volkswagen remained the No. 1 automaker in the market, increasing a modest 2.3 percent to 3.5 million vehicles VOLKSWAGEN Volkswagen sales hit record of 10.74 million in 2017 FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German automaker Volkswagen had record sales of 10.74 million vehicles last year as markets in Brazil and Russia rebounded strongly. Sales rose 4.3 percent from 10.30 million in 2016, when Volkswagen passed Japanese rival Toyota to become the globe's largest auto producer for that year. The figures show the Wolfsburg-based company continuing its effort to move past a scandal that broke in September 2015 over cars it had rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests. Sales last year were boosted by a strong December, when sales rose 8.5 percent. For the year, the company saw big jumps in Russia and Brazil, and significant gains in China and the United States. CEO Matthias Mueller said in a statement Wednesday that ""we are thankful for the trust of our customers."" CHINA-APPLE SUPPLIER Apple supplier denies charges of unsafe, unclean conditions SHANGHAI (AP) — An Apple Inc. supplier in eastern China has denied allegations by a New York rights group that its workers toil for ten-hour shifts in loud, polluted conditions, without proper overtime pay or adequate safety protections to make MacBook and iPhone parts. The manufacturer was responding Wednesday to a report by China Labor Watch that an undercover investigation from October to this month found workers without proper gloves and irritated, peeling skin, among other safety hazards. It said the workers were accommodated in filthy dormitories with cold showers that lacked emergency exits. The charges highlight the difficulty of managing complex global supply chains — even for companies that have publicly embraced ethical sourcing as a business priority. Apple Inc. said an inspection found no evidence the factory was violating its standards. EARNS-BANK OF AMERICA Bank of America 4Q profits fall by 48 percent due to tax law NEW YORK (AP) — Bank of America says its fourth-quarter profits fell by nearly half from a year ago, as the bank had to book $2.9 billion in charges related to the new tax law. The consumer banking giant said it earned $2.37 billion, or 20 cents a share, down from $4.54 billion, or 39 cents a share, from the same period a year ago. Like other banks this quarter, Bank of America had to write down $2.9 billion in deferred tax assets and other investments to comply with the new tax law. However the bank, like its competitors, says it expects to benefit from lower tax rates going forward. Total revenue at the bank was $20.44 billion, up from $19.99 billion in the same period a year earlier.

1358,"TOKYO (AP) — Honda Motor Co. of Japan and U.S. automaker General Motors Co. agreed Thursday to work together in developing batteries for electric vehicles, mainly for the North American market. The companies will collaborate based on GM's next-generation battery system, both sides said. That will allow both manufacturers to continue to keep distinct products, while saving on costs for customers, they said. Detroit-based GM and Tokyo-based Honda already work together on fuel cell vehicles, which are zero-emission and run on the power created when hydrogen fuel combines with oxygen in the air to produce water. They have a manufacturing joint venture to produce a hydrogen fuel cell system in 2020, including trying to make fuel cells and hydrogen storage more affordable. They also both have electric vehicles in their model lineup. Pressure is growing on automakers to become more environmentally friendly as well as develop other technology for vehicles such as semi-autonomous driving. Nissan Motor Co., one of the leaders in electric vehicles, is working with partner Renault SA of France on electric vehicle technology, while Toyota Motor Corp. is working with Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp.

1363,"DETROIT (AP) — Japanese air bag maker Takata is recalling an additional 3.3 million faulty air bag inflators as it expands the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. The latest recalls cover frontal air bags in certain 2009, 2010 and 2013 vehicles made Honda, Toyota, Audi, BMW, Daimler Vans, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Tesla. Automakers will provide specific models in paperwork that will be filed later this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Notices of the expanded recalls were posted Saturday . Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 20 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection. The recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority. Many automakers have been slow to replace the potentially deadly inflators. A report by an independent monitor said that as of Sept. 15, 2017, automakers have recalled 43.1 million inflators. Of those, only 18.5 million, or 43 percent, have been replaced even though Takata recalls began in 2001. NHTSA has said the Takata recalls are unprecedented in size and complexity and have resulted in groundbreaking lessons that will help automakers reach their repair goals. The agency said it is monitoring the automakers' progress and working to expand best practices to boost completion rates. The agency also has the authority to fine automakers that don't make recall repairs in a timely manner.",264,269,Auto Brand,447
1384,"DETROIT (AP) — January's U.S. auto sales were a little better than a year ago, but most analysts and automakers predict a small full-year decline despite economic factors that favor the industry. Automakers reported a 1 percent increase last month to 1.15 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. But Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, the country's largest dealership group, said late-model used cars coming off leases are pulling buyers from higher-priced new vehicles. Despite tax reform, low unemployment and strong consumer confidence, he sees new-car sales falling to 16.8 million from last year's 17.2 million. During the past few years, automakers pushed leasing to around 30 percent of sales. Now, Jackson says 4 million well-equipped used cars will be available for an average price of $25,000. ""You have to say 'who is going to buy all these things when they come back?'"" Jackson said. ""Of course there's going to be a cannibalization and a substitution."" Car sales fell nearly 11 percent while truck and SUV sales were up 8 percent. Here are the numbers released by automakers Thursday: — Honda Motor Co. said sales were down 1.7 percent to 104,542. Truck and SUV sales fell 2.5 percent while cars were off just under 1 percent. The CR-V small SUV, in the hottest part of the market, saw a 16.9 percent sales drop. — Hyundai Motor Co. sales fell 11.3 percent from last year's record January, to 39,629. The car-heavy Korean automaker saw Sonata midsize sedan sales tumble 23.7 percent. — Nissan Group sales rose 10 percent to 123,538, a January record. Sales were led by the Rogue small SUV, which was up nearly 26 percent to more than 36,000. Nissan brand sales rose 12 percent but Infiniti luxury sales dropped 8 percent. — Ford Motor Co. sales fell 6.6 percent to 161,143, due in part to a decline in sales to rental car fleets. But its average vehicle sales price hit a record $37,000, largely due to a 1.6 percent sales increase for the higher priced F-Series pickup. Car sales were down 23.3 percent. — General Motors Co. sales rose 1 percent to 198,548. Buick and Chevrolet posted gains, but GMC and Cadillac saw lower sales. GM's best-seller, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup, saw a 14.5 percent jump. A new Silverado goes on sale later this year, so GM is discounting the outgoing truck. — Toyota Motor Corp. posted a 16.8 percent increase to 167,056 vehicles on strong demand for the RAV4, Highlander and 4Runner SUVs, which hit January sales records. Sales of the revamped Camry midsize car rose 21.3 percent, bucking the SUV trend. — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were down 13 percent due to reduced sales to fleet buyers. The company sold nearly 133,000 vehicles, led by a 2 percent increase in Jeep sales. But the Chrysler brand fell 21 percent while Dodge was off 31 percent and Fiat dropped 43 percent.

1391,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — In the future Nissan envisions, driverless cars will pick up children from school and recommend restaurants to tourists in various languages. Nissan Motor Co. says feedback from people who try it will be used to fine-tune its ""robo-vehicle mobility service."" The automaker said Friday that 300 people have already signed up to try out Easy Ride next month. The Japanese automaker hopes to roll it out as a commercial service in the early 2020s. Details, including pricing, are undecided. The service was developed in a partnership, which began last year, with Japanese mobile game provider DeNA Co. DeNA has been working on driverless bus and delivery services in Japan. For now, Easy Ride will be limited to a 4.5-kilometer (2.8-mile) course that starts from Nissan headquarters and winds through a shopping mall area in this port city. The app is only in Japanese, but there are plans to offer it in several languages for tourists and other travelers. Like other autonomous drive technology, the Easy Ride vehicle is packed with cameras, sensors and radars to recognize pedestrians, intersections, traffic lights and other vehicles. It's still only driverless in principle, though, since Japanese law doesn't allow totally driverless vehicles. So a human driver in a no-hands position sits behind the steering wheel. The system isn't flawless, with human intervention sometimes needed to avoid a crash, according to Nissan. It's just one of several such kinds of technology being worked on around the world, such as Google's Waymo and Tesla's Autopilot. Just about all the major automakers, including Mercedes and Toyota, are working on such technologies. Nissan has been among the most aggressive. Although opinion is divided on the projection that as many as 10 million driverless cars will be on roads by 2020, everyone agrees the technology is going to grow. ""I think the potential is quite large in the long term, especially in large cities such as Tokyo or Boston, where there is a need for point-to-point transit but little incentive to own cars,"" said Nicholas Evans, an assistant professor at UMass Lowell. However, he cautioned, ""In introducing technology, all it takes is for a couple of high-profile accidents for consumers to turn against manufacturers. ""It's in the self-interest of manufacturers for rigorous testing and public input on this new kind of technology,"" said Evans, who studies the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies such as drones and self-driving vehicles. Ogi Redzic, senior vice president for the alliance among Nissan, Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said Easy Ride's technology will deliver safer rides because most accidents are caused by human error. Redzic, who oversees the alliance's connected vehicles and mobility services, sees fail-proof cybersecurity as crucial. Driverless mobility services could also help make up for growing labor shortages, reduce traffic and parking problems and help energize depopulated areas, Redzic told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a news conference Friday announcing the service. For Easy Ride, users first download a special app on their cellphones. After logging on, voice recognition is used to set a destination, and the date and time for when the ride picks you up at one of four possible spots in Yokohama. A display visible from the vehicle's back seat shows its route on a digital map. It also recommends events such as concerts, historical landmarks, restaurants and other places to visit, which pop up as photos and text on the display. The service also includes coupons that can be downloaded and used at those spots. Some glitches remain. In a recent demonstration, the app had trouble launching because of a poor internet connection at Nissan headquarters. When a reporter said, ""I want to eat a burger,"" it successfully recommended several nearby joints. But it was not able to find the nearest New Balance store, or any other place to buy sneakers. ____ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",1639,1644,Auto Brand,449

1412,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. auto industry's historic growth streak has ended, but demand for new vehicles — especially SUVs — remains healthy as the new year begins. U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million in 2017, according to Autodata Corp. It was their first year-over-year decline since 2009, ending an unprecedented seven-year expansion. General Motors, Toyota and Ford all reported a 1 percent declines in sales last year compared to 2016. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 8 percent. Honda's sales were flat, while Nissan's rose 2 percent. Volkswagen brand sales rose 5 percent. While sales fell short of 2016's record of 17.55 million, 2017 was still the fourth-best sales year in U.S. history, after 2000, 2015 and 2016, according to Kelley Blue Book. ""It's still a buoyant industry and the underlying factors that drive it are still very positive,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales chief. Analysts think sales will fall a bit further this year. While low unemployment and rising consumer confidence are expected to boost demand, rising interest rates could make it more expensive for people to finance new vehicles. ""That's real money to consumers,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist with Cox Automotive, which owns AutoTrader.com and other car-buying sites. Vehicles also are becoming more durable so consumers can keep them longer, further putting a drag on sales. The average age of vehicles on the road has climbed to 11.6 years, up from 8.8 years in 1998. The growing popularity of leasing will also have a big impact on 2018 sales. Almost one-third of new vehicle sales were leases in 2015, and many of those 4 million lessees will be trading in their vehicles for new ones, according to the car buying site Edmunds.com. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) But leasing also has a downside for automakers, since the influx of late-model used cars returning to the market will cut into sales of new vehicles. Tax cuts also could be a mixed blessing. They will likely stimulate demand, particularly for commercial trucks and vans. But the more the economy grows, the more likely it is that the government will raise interest rates, Chesbrough said. Here are more details of December and 2017 sales: —WINNERS AND LOSERS: Ford's F-Series pickup truck remained the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. in 2017, a title it has now held for 36 years. Ford sold 896,764 F-Series trucks in the U.S. last year, or nearly two trucks every minute, partly because of post-hurricane demand in Texas and Florida. Low gas prices and other factors had buyers ditching cars for SUVs at a fast clip; sales of the Nissan Rogue SUV jumped 22 percent to more than 400,000. But car-heavy brands like Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat all saw their sales drop by double-digit percentages. Toyota Prius hybrid sales plummeted 20.5 percent. — LUXURY CROWN: Mercedes-Benz's sales fell 1 percent to 337,246, but that was still enough to make it the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. for the second straight year. BMW eked out a second-place finish just ahead of Lexus. But some luxury brands struggled. Cadillac and Lexus both saw their sales drop 8 percent last year; Lincoln sales plummeted 17 percent in December. LaNeve said mainstream brands are getting so luxurious that many buyers don't feel the need to step up to a luxury label. — PILING ON THE DEALS: New vehicle prices hit a record last year, averaging $36,113 as buyers bought bigger SUVs and added more safety and infotainment features, Kelley Blue Book said. At the same time, automakers piled on deals in order to juice sales and hang on to their market share. Automakers spent an average of $4,302 per vehicle in incentives last month, passing the previous record set in November, according to the consulting firm J.D. Power. Chevrolet was offering $11,000 off a 2017 Silverado pickup last month. Analysts expect a pullback in incentive spending this year as automakers cut inventory. But there will still be good deals, especially on slow-selling vehicles like midsize sedans. — DECEMBER DIP: No one was expecting U.S. auto sales to top December 2016, which was the best single month in 15 years. Sales dropped 5 percent to 1.6 million last month. Ford's sales were up 1 percent in December as its new large SUVs hit the market, and Hyundai's sales rose 2 percent. But most other automakers saw declines. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 11 percent , while Toyota's sales dropped 8 percent and Nissan's sales were down 9.5 percent. GM's sales fell 3 percent.

1420,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Having started a trade war with China and enraged U.S. allies with steel tariffs, President Donald Trump is primed for his next fight. He is targeting a product at the heart of the American experience: cars. Trump's latest plan is to consider slapping tariffs on imported autos and auto parts — a move he says would aid American workers but that could inflate car prices, make U.S. manufacturers less competitive and draw retaliation from other nations. The action has also begun to provoke a backlash among member of Congress, who have so far been reluctant to challenge Trump policies that are upending decades of U.S. policies. On Thursday, manufacturers, suppliers, car dealers and foreign diplomats will line up to testify at a Washington hearing to try to head off auto tariffs. After the hearing, the Commerce Department will decide whether to label imported vehicles and auto parts a threat to America's national security and whether to recommend tariffs to the president. In announcing the auto investigation in May, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said, ""There is evidence that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry."" Yet even General Motors, which ostensibly would benefit from a tax on its foreign competition, is opposed to Trump's plan. And even considering the administration's trade war with China over Beijing's predatory practices in high-tech industries and even after imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from America's closest allies, Trump's auto tariffs raise the ante substantially: The U.S. last year imported $192 billion in vehicles and $143 billion in auto parts — figures that dwarf the $29 billion in steel and $23 billion in aluminum imports and the $34 billion in Chinese goods the administration has so far hit with tariffs. ""This is really taking it up one gigantic notch,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist who studies trade. ""I do think it may be a bridge too far."" In the Senate, Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama and Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have announced plans to introduce legislation opposing Trump's proposed 25 percent auto tariffs. Both warned that the tariffs threaten tens of thousands of jobs in their states. ""Foreign automobiles and auto parts are not a threat to our national security,"" Jones said. ""But you know what is a threat? A 25 percent tax on the price of these imported goods."" Nor is America's auto industry itself crying for help against foreign competition. U.S auto sales reached 17.2 million last year — the fourth-best haul on record. Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, U.S. automakers and parts suppliers have added 343,000 jobs. Despite Trump's threat, the auto trade war might not happen anytime soon, if at all. The president might be angling to use the tariffs to pressure the European Union to lower its own auto tariffs or prod Mexico to agree to a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement more favorable to the United States. ""I'm hoping it's just bluster,"" said Paul Ritchie, owner of Honda and Kia dealerships in Maryland and Pennsylvania. ""I understand where the administration is coming from. Our trade imbalances should be corrected. I'm not sure you can take 25-30 years of neglect on trade imbalances and try to fix it in six months."" Even if the auto tariffs aren't just a negotiating ploy, it could take time before they kick in: It took 10 months for the steel and aluminum tariffs — also justified on national security grounds — to go from proposal to reality. In targeting steel, aluminum and perhaps autos, the administration has weaponized an obscure provision of trade policy: The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 empowers a president to impose unlimited tariffs on particular imports if the Commerce Department finds that those imports threaten national security. The administration has defined national security broadly, suggesting that anything that hurts U.S. economic competitiveness damages national security — ""an argument you can apply to any industry you want,"" noted Philip Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former White House trade adviser. Automakers, in the meantime, have warned that tariffs would raise their costs — and their customers'. In comments filed with the government, GM warned that that ""increased import tariffs could lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less —not more — U.S. jobs."" Even companies that build cars in America rely on imported parts that would be subject to the tariffs, thereby raising automakers' costs. ""There is no automaker that has 100 percent exclusively U.S.-sourced parts,"" said Brian Krinock, Toyota's senior vice president for North American factories. ""It is a global business with global operations."" Toyota manufactures nine models in the United States, all of which use some imported parts. About 30 percent of the Camry's parts are imported, Krinock said, and a 25 percent tariff on those parts would raise the cost of a Camry by $1,800. The Toyota Sienna, made in Princeton, Indiana, would be nearly $3,000 more expensive, he said, and the Tundra pickup truck, made in San Antonio, Texas, would cost $2,800 more. Car collectors, too, have written to Commerce to express their opposition to the tariffs. ""I have been a lifelong car enthusiast, and old cars pose no threat to national security. Neither do their parts,"" wrote Mark Gillett of Dallas, urging Commerce to exempt cars and parts ""of a certain age."" Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimated that the tariffs would raise auto prices overall by 9 percent to as high as 21 percent for luxury models. They would cut the industry's output 1.5 percent and cost 195,000 jobs, a Peterson analysis found. Then there's the threat of retaliation from U.S. trading partners. Toyota exports eight U.S.-made models to 31 countries; those exports could be hit by retaliatory tariffs, Krinock said. Nearly 98 percent of the cars and trucks that would be hit by the tariffs are imported from U.S. allies: The European Union, Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea. If all those countries retaliated by slapping their 25 percent duties on U.S. car exports, it would deepen the impact on the U.S. economy and cost up to 1.2 million jobs in the United States, Posen estimated. The Commerce Department originally set two days of hearings about the proposed auto tariffs, but then cut that to one day. Posen said that cutting back on the time for industry representatives to testify suggests the administration already expects to impose the tariffs. ""This is something where they predetermined the outcome,"" he said. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit.

1421,"DETROIT (AP) — Toyota says it will start equipping models with technology to talk to other vehicles starting in 2021, as it tries to push safety communications forward. The company says most of its U.S. models should have the feature by the mid-2020s. Vehicle-to-vehicle signals can warn others of heavy braking ahead or that another vehicle is headed into their path. Vice President of Product Planning Andrew Coetzee (Cute-ZEE) says the cars would use dedicated airwaves to send signals up to 984 feet (300 meters). Coetzee hopes other automakers will join. Others are testing it and standards have been developed so they can communicate. Toyota is leading on automatic emergency braking, making it standard on all but four models.

1455,"It won't be long before incoming freshmen head off to college. That means it's prime time for students — and parents — to find suitable, affordable cars for the road ahead. Edmunds has compiled a list of used hybrid, compact and crossover SUV vehicles that best lend themselves to varied demands of college life. We chose vehicles for their strong value, utility, fuel efficiency, performance and the availability of advanced safety features. We also offer some other alternatives in our picks' respective classes. The prices shown are the average prices paid for the cars at a franchised car dealership, compiled by Edmunds. Average used transaction price: $16,430 Estimated fuel economy: 47 mpg combined (49 city/45 highway) Though Honda only sold the second-generation Accord Hybrid for the 2014 and 2015 model years, it holds up well, even when compared to new hybrid sedans. Its spacious cabin easily seats four adults. On the safety front, all models come with a rearview camera and an additional camera that displays what's in the driver's right-side blind spot. EX-L and Touring models further add lane departure and forward collision warning systems. If the Accord Hybrid doesn't appeal, several other worthy midsize hybrid sedans are worth a look. Chief among these is the Ford Fusion Hybrid, with a similarly roomy interior and excellent ride comfort. Maximum cargo capacity isn't great in either car, but the Fusion's rear seats fold down to accommodate larger items. Overall, the Accord is more desirable for its superior fuel economy, quicker acceleration and more intuitive touchscreen system. It also holds its value better than the Fusion. Average used transaction price: $13,826 Estimated fuel economy (automatic): 27 mpg combined (24 city/33 highway) Hybrids are great for saving on gas, but college-bound shoppers who want excitement will want to look elsewhere. Luckily, there are a handful of cars that are both fun and sensible. The standout in this group is the sixth-generation Volkswagen GTI, produced from 2010 to 2014. A sport-tuned suspension and turbocharged engine provide the thrills, while high-quality interior materials and eye-catching upholstery make the GTI feel more refined than its primary rivals. We think the GTI offers the best blend of performance and comfort, but there are competitors also worth considering. The Ford Focus ST is notable for its bold styling cues, beefier engine and larger cargo area. The Ford's stiffer ride, subpar infotainment system and lack of an automatic transmission option make the GTI a better choice for everyday driving. Note that the sixth-generation GTI actually carried on until 2014, but the final model year offered fewer choices: It had a limited color palette, only two trim levels and ditched the available two-door body style. Average used transaction price: $12,770 Estimated fuel economy (automatic-equipped hatchback with 2.0L engine): 33 mpg combined (29 city/39 highway) For those who like the GTI's utility but need something more affordable, a standard compact car might be the best choice. The Mazda 3 is a good representative. The Mazda's interior is one of the nicest in the segment, with plenty of soft-touch plastics. It's a tech-rich car as well: There's a dash-mounted screen with high-quality graphics, an available head-up display, and safety options such as blind-spot monitoring, a rearview camera and forward collision warning. It's also one of the most fun-to-drive compact cars on the road. Popular rivals include the Honda Civic and the Ford Focus. But thanks to its many standard and optional features, excellent driving dynamics and nifty fold-flat seats, the Mazda 3 shines brighter. Average used transaction price: $21,235 Estimated fuel economy (LE and XLE): 26 mpg combined (23 city/30 highway) Though small cars and hybrids are useful and fuel-efficient, they can't carry much. For students who are moving cross-country or who frequently transport large items, a crossover is the way to go. The Toyota RAV4 is a solid pick due to its comfortable ride, generous amount of interior space, and Toyota's reputation for reliability. It's also available with all-wheel drive, which can provide extra traction in snowy conditions. While the fourth-generation RAV4 has been on sale since 2013, a handful of noteworthy additions make newer RAV4s more desirable. For 2015, Toyota revised the RAV4's front structure to improve its crash scores, while 2016 brought a restyled front end and the introduction of a host of advanced safety features. The RAV4 isn't the most exciting vehicle in the class. The Ford Escape offers more powerful engines, and the Mazda CX-5 stands out for its impressive handling. But the RAV4's all-around competence and widely available safety equipment make it a top choice. EDMUNDS SAYS: A number of newer used cars provide good value for students heading off to college while offering the features and little luxuries that make a new life that much more fun. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1458,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators have released models from 14 different automakers that are being recalled to replace potentially deadly Takata air bag inflators. Documents posted Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration include many made by Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Daimler Vans, Toyota, Tesla, BMW, Fiat  Chrysler, Mazda, Subaru, Jaguar-Land Rover, McLaren and Volkswagen. , and released some of their models last week. Earlier this month Takata faulty air bag inflators as it expanded the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. Models released Thursday are equipped with those inflators. The company uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 21 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The U.S. recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority. Some of the recalls are limited to certain groups of states. To see if your vehicle is involved, go to https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls and key in your 17-digit vehicle identification number. It can be found on your registration and is stamped on the driver's side dashboard. Automakers and the government say the recall repairs should be done as soon as possible. The latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection.

1462,"CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — It's been 16 years since Mark Martin won the Coca-Cola 600, and a Ford driver has not been to victory lane for the marquee event since. A Ford driver hasn't hoisted a Cup championship trophy since 2004, either. There have been some highlights during this past decade of mediocrity, but coming up empty every year in the chase for NASCAR's biggest prize got very tiring to the Ford group. ""Four years ago we got very serious about, 'We don't just want to be here, we want to be here to win,'"" said Mark Rushbrook, global director at Ford Motor Co. ""To do that, we knew we had to fix everything."" Ford Performance was launched along with a technical center created as the headquarters for engineers to assist its teams across multiple series. Its first success came two years later when Ford returned to Le Mans on the 50th anniversary of its 1966 victory and won the GT class. Gains have been made across all Ford's motorsports programs, and the company is currently the hottest manufacturer in NASCAR. Ford has won seven of the 12 Cup points races this season, its 2,296 laps led account for 59 percent and Ford drivers have 17 stage victories. Kevin Harvick is the force behind that success with five Cup victories, including the last two. Add his Saturday night win in the $1 million All-Star race, and Harvick is on a three-race winning streak. That bodes well for Ford in Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600, a race Ford drivers won four consecutive years from 1999-2002. The blue oval has not triumphed in NASCAR's longest race of the year since. Harvick has five of the Ford seven wins this season, and Joey Logano and Clint Bowyer have also been to victory lane. Ford drivers hold seven of the top 10 spots in the Cup standings. Matt Kenseth, who drove a Ford to two Daytona 500 wins and the 2003 championship, returned to the manufacturer earlier this month to help Roush Fenway Racing catch Ford front-runners Stewart-Haas Racing and Team Penske. Logano, winner at Talladega this year, noted Toyota was the dominating brand at this point last season. SHR, in its first year with Ford, wasn't a strong title contender and Penske drivers Logano and Brad Keselowski felt overmatched in their aged Fusions. Ford will move to the Mustang in an update in 2019, but tweaks to the rules package have helped Ford teams catch Toyota. ""Last year, the Toyotas were on fire and really good,"" Logano said. ""I think this year with some of the rules changes and really the way the rules have been regulated, enforced, it has brought it to more of an equal playing field."" Kurt Busch was the last Ford driver to win a Cup title, in the 2004 launch of the playoff system, and it capped consecutive championships for the manufacturer. He believes the commitment from the company has always been the same, from Edsel Ford II on down, but the engineering support has dramatically improved. ""The Ford Performance group, I see it everywhere, with all their different forms of motorsport collaborating together,"" Busch said. ""Whereas Ford Racing before ... felt like it was more focused on the NASCAR program and didn't use information from IndyCar or Cosworth in Formula One or sports cars. What I see now is information channels that are able to communicate quickly and gather data from all different branches of motorsports that Ford is involved in."" Ford Performance initially housed a simulator used exclusively by its NASCAR teams. IMSA and WEC programs began using it, and the simulator has graduated into use for both Ford Performance production cars and now mainstream Ford products. To prepare for Le Mans, the drivers from Chip Ganassi Racing drove thousands of miles of Le Mans simulation so that the track would not be foreign when the manufacturer made its ballyhooed return. Ford's sole intent was to celebrate its 50th anniversary victory by winning the race, and with just one test on the track before the 24-hour race, the Tech Center was critical in preparing the program. Ford Performance began with seven engineers in 2013 and now has 45. They are busy preparing the Mustang for Cup introduction next year, and also the Mustang for the Supercars Series in Australia. Rushbrook said Ford Performance is reminded often about its Cup championship drought, and believes the program has nine drivers capable of winning races and contending for the title. Harvick is having a season like Truex did last year in which the championship appears to be his and Ford's to lose, but the Ford program is strong across the board. ''We certainly don't want to be peaking too early,"" said Rushbrook, ""but we are definitely here to win races and championships.""",2015,2020,Auto Brand,455
1468,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia's transport minister said Tuesday that the government will take an active role in recalls to replace flawed Takata air bags after data from eight car manufacturers showed that more than 350,000 car owners have not responded. The deaths of seven people in Malaysia have been linked to the defective air bags that are subject to one of the world's largest auto recall. The latest victim was a 23-year old student whose 2004 Honda City crashed May 27 in Kuala Lumpur, the second death this year alone. Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the Road Transport Department will take over from auto manufacturers in sending recall notices to affected car owners. He said that two reminders will be sent and car owners who still fail to respond will face fines and be barred from renewing their road registrations. Such radical measures are needed to raise awareness due to the lackadaisical attitude of some Malaysians, he said. ""We are not here to penalize anybody. We just want to make sure everyone changes their airbags for their own safety because the cars have been recalled,"" he told a news conference after meeting with the car manufacturers. Regarding the latest fatality, Loke said Honda sent 28 recall notices to the victim's family but failed to reach them because they had moved without updating their address. He said the road department will work with insurance companies to track down such owners. All seven deaths in Malaysia involved the Honda City, a subcompact model made for Asia and Europe. Families of some Malaysian victims have blamed Honda, the leading foreign brand in the country, of not doing enough to warn car owners of potentially deadly risks from the air bags or track down second-hand car owners. Loke said Honda has completed 79 percent of its recall, the highest so far in the industry. Of the 358,233 cars that have yet to respond to the recalls 70,162 are Hondas, 144,607 are Toyotas, 105,817 are Nissans, 19,985 are Mitsubishis and the rest are BWMs, Subarus, Mazdas and Lexuses, he said. Automakers have been told to work together to raise awareness about the flawed air bags since earlier company campaigns have been ineffective. Honda will have until the year's end to complete its recalls, since all the accidents so far involved Hondas. Other manufacturers will be given a year. ""This is a four-year problem that is not resolved ... we want 100 percent compliance but it takes time,"" Loke added. The latest Malaysian death raised the global death toll linked to the defect to 23. The U.S., with 15 deaths, and Australia with one are the only other countries to have reported such fatalities. The defective air bags have faulty inflators and propellant devices that may deploy improperly in an accident, shooting out metal fragments that can kill or injure. Last year, Takata pleaded guilty to fraud in a U.S. court and agreed to pay more than $1 billion in penalties for concealing the defect. Various lawsuits are pending in U.S. courts against Takata, including several class action lawsuits that allege automakers knew about the dangers of the defective air bags ahead of the recalls. Takata has since been bought over by Chinese-owned U.S. mobility safety company Key Safety System.",1946,1951,Auto Brand,456

JAPAN-TAKATA Takata acquired by Key Safety Systems, president resigns TOKYO (AP) — Takata Corp., the Japanese air bag maker embroiled in a massive recall, says the acquisition by U.S. mobility safety company Key Safety Systems has been completed, and the president resigned. Takata President Shigehisa Takada says he has resigned as president and chairman, replaced by Yoichiro Nomura, chief financial officer, effective Wednesday. Takata went into rehabilitation proceedings last year, slammed by the massive costs and sales damage from defective Takata air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spew shrapnel into a vehicle's drivers and passengers. At least 22 deaths and more than 180 injuries have been linked to the defect. Some 50 million Takata air bag inflators have been recalled in the United States and millions more globally.

Under the deal signed today, each company will maintain independence, but executive teams will work together to map out cooperation on innovating technology and leveraging market positions. The arrival of the digital age and robotics in the auto industry is pressuring automakers around the world to deliver to customers vehicles that connect to the net or avoid crashes automatically. Partnerships can save costs and boost competitiveness. The deal brings together two major players in trucks and buses, a sector that some analysts say can benefit the most from such new technology.

MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINE Mountain Valley Pipeline proposes expansion into N. Carolina RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Developers of the Mountain Valley Pipeline want to extend the project from Virginia into North Carolina. The extension of the natural gas pipeline, which begins in West Virginia, is called MVP Southgate. The new segment would receive gas from the Mountain Valley Pipeline mainline in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and extend approximately 70 miles south to new delivery points in Rockingham and Alamance counties in North Carolina.

The announcement Thursday won't affect existing permits for exploration or extraction, meaning the industry is likely to continue in the South Pacific nation for several more decades. Still, the move is a change in direction after voters last year elected the liberal government led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. That followed nine years of conservative leadership under a government that favored expanding the industry. Ardern has pledged to go green by reducing the country's net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.

1501,"The 2019 model year marks the start of a new cycle for some of America's top trucks, led by redesigned pickups from Chevrolet and Ram. Ford's top-selling F-150 had updates in 2018, and more may be in the offing for 2019. Typically, Japanese truckmakers Nissan and Toyota aren't far behind with their own updates. Edmunds breaks down what you need to know about today's crop of full-size pickups. Arriving at dealers in the fall, the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado features a ground-up redesign that results in a longer, lighter pickup. Weight savings of around 450 pounds should pay dividends for fuel economy and acceleration. The new Silverado offers a taller driving position and more room in crew-cab models. It also has the largest cargo box in its class and a power-lowering and -raising tailgate that's exclusive to the class. The Silverado offers a variety of engines: a V6 (285 horsepower), a V8 (355 horsepower), a larger and stronger V8 (420 horsepower), and a turbocharged four-cylinder (310 horsepower). A six-cylinder diesel arrives in early 2019. The Silverado's mechanical twin, the GMC Sierra, is also new and goes on sale in the fall. The 2019 Sierra will offer a more upscale interior than the Chevy, along with other exclusive features such as a carbon-fiber cargo box and enhanced technology. The MSRP for a 2019 Silverado crew cab ranges from $34,600 to $53,000. Perennially the top-selling vehicle in America, the F-150 reigns supreme among full-size trucks. Multiple trims and configurations, four engine options, and remarkable capabilities make the F-150 a benchmark. Engines include a new base-level 3.3-liter V6 (290 horsepower), along with two turbo V6 options (325 horsepower or 375 horsepower), a V8 (395 horsepower) and a new diesel V6 (250 horsepower). With towing capacity of up to 13,200 pounds and up to 25 mpg combined city/highway fuel economy, there's not much the F-150 can't do. There's even the bonkers 450-horsepower Raptor edition that can traverse broad swaths of off-road terrain without breaking a sweat. The MSRP for a 2018 F-150 crew cab ranges from $34,245 to $60,850. The 2019 F-150 is expected to be released later this summer. Built in Mississippi, the Titan is nearly as American as its domestic rivals despite its Japanese origins. The current Titan was redesigned for 2017 with a bold new look and a new XD model that splits the difference between the capabilities of regular half-ton and heavy-duty pickups. The Titan offers a single 390-horsepower V8 engine and can tow up to 9,740 pounds. The XD version comes with the same V8 or an optional diesel V8 that helps the truck tow up to 12,640 pounds. The Titan's not our first choice among full-size pickups, but it's roomy and comfortable and it delivers legitimate capability at an attractive price. The MSRP for a 2018 Nissan Titan crew cab ranges from $35,930 to $56,800. The 2019 Nissan Titan arrives this fall. Ram shook up the truck world a decade ago with a new rear suspension design that delivered sedan-like ride comfort without sacrificing capability. A refined, comfortable cabin and advanced tech features made its rivals look like archaic work trucks almost overnight. The rivals have since caught up, but the new Ram, thoroughly overhauled for 2019 and now on sale, continues to innovate. A new frame and body design yield more room for rear passengers and reduce weight by about 200 pounds. The Ram's V8 engine (395 horsepower) returns with a revamped eight-speed transmission that makes more timely shifts. There's also a 3.6-liter V6 base engine that will be paired up with an electric-assist system for smoother power and acceleration and a maximum tow capacity of 12,750 pounds. Redesigned front seats, new technology features and an optional 12-inch infotainment display add to the Ram's winning streak of refinement. The MSRP for a 2019 Ram 1500 crew cab ranges from $34,495 to $56,495. The Tundra has gone the longest of any in this group without a full redesign. It's still plenty capable, offering two V8 engines (310 horsepower and 381 horsepower), two body styles and three bed lengths. It can tow up to 10,200 pounds, carry a 1,730-pound payload and handle itself well off-road. The Tundra also is built in the U.S. The aging Tundra could benefit from a diesel engine (increased towing strength), a smaller turbocharged V6 (better fuel economy) and a thorough technology update. Still, the Tundra has a charm for certain truck buyers. The MSRP for a 2018 Toyota Tundra crew cab ranges from $35,450 to $50,330. The 2019 model arrives in the fall. EDMUNDS SAYS: With new designs from Chevrolet and Ram and further refinements to the venerable F-150, it's a great time for full-size truck shoppers. Most pickups offer similar capabilities, so look for such qualities as comfort and innovative technology to make a difference. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1524,"TOKYO (AP) — A perk from U.S. tax reforms is helping lift Nissan's fiscal third quarter profit, although costs had to be earmarked and sales were dented by news of improper vehicle inspections at its plants in Japan. Nissan Motor Co. reported Thursday an October-December profit of 301.6 billion yen ($2.7 billion), up dramatically from 131.7 billion yen a year earlier. The tax reforms under President Donald Trump are a boost for Japanese automakers. The company said quarterly sales fell 2 percent to 2.88 trillion yen ($26 billion). Nissan acknowledged last year that unauthorized workers were routinely conducting inspections. The faulty inspections affected only vehicles sold in Japan, not exports, but an investigation found the dubious inspections were systematic and had been going on for years. Nissan, allied with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan, recalled more than a million vehicles in Japan for further inspections. Nissan executives have repeatedly apologized for the scandal, and some executives have returned some of their pay. But the company has also been eager to put the scandal behind it and Nissan sales are doing well in other parts of the world. When combined with its allied partners, Nissan is one of the biggest automakers in the world, rivaling Volkswagen AG of Germany and Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan. Nissan, which also makes the March subcompact and Infiniti luxury models, lowered its vehicle sales forecast for the fiscal year through March by 50,000 units to 5.78 million vehicles. Nissan is benefiting by being a leader in pure electric vehicles. It started selling the Leaf electric car in 2010. The Leaf is one of the first affordable mass-produced electric vehicles available to regular consumers. The interest in going electric is growing because China, a huge auto market, is pushing automakers to develop EV technology and encouraging sales with subsidies. Automakers also face quotas in China that require electrics to make up at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year. Nissan announced earlier this week it's developing 20 electric vehicles as part of a $10 billion, five-year investment program with its Chinese partner Dongfeng Group. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at Her work can be found at",1330,1335,Auto Brand,460

1547,"Most of us know the new-car basic warranty, often referred to as the ""bumper-to-bumper warranty,"" is designed to protect the owner against any factory defects during the first few years of ownership. But did you know this coverage doesn't actually apply to the bumpers? The vehicle's bumpers are considered body panels and so aren't covered. The basic warranty is just one kind of coverage that comes standard on a new car. Here's an overview of new-car warranties and seven things you might not know about them: WARRANTY BASICS A new car comes with a basic or limited warranty, which covers everything except body panels, drivetrain components and wear-and-tear items such as brake pads, oil filters and wiper blades. It also comes with a drivetrain warranty, which covers most of the parts that make the car move, such as the engine, transmission, drive axles and driveshaft. Most carmakers provide roadside assistance. Some also offer free maintenance for a period of time. FINE PRINT ON 10-YEAR POWERTRAIN WARRANTIES Automakers Hyundai, Kia and Mitsubishi tout their decade-long powertrain warranties, and that's great for new-car buyers who plan to hold on to their car for a while. But if you plan on buying one of those cars used, that 10-year warranty doesn't apply to you. You'll only get a five-year, 60,000-mile warranty dating from when the vehicle was first sold. A partial way around this issue is to buy the car as a certified pre-owned vehicle from a dealership. If there was a 10-year powertrain warranty, you'll get the remainder of that term, probably seven or so years. TIRES HAVE A SEPARATE WARRANTY New-car tires are not covered by the vehicle's basic warranty. Instead, the warranty comes from the tiremaker, and it's outlined in a booklet you should find in your new car's glove box. The tire warranty protects against premature tire wear or manufacturing defects. Make sure you keep the tires properly inflated and hold onto receipts from any tire rotations you have done, just in case you need to file a warranty claim and are asked to prove that the tires were properly maintained. WARRANTY COVERAGE CAN CHANGE Warranties and their included benefits are subject to change. If an automaker wants to spur sales, it may offer a longer warranty or other special coverage, such as free maintenance. If the car company's research shows that a certain benefit isn't driving people to dealerships, it can reduce the coverage. Back in 2010, for example, Volvo offered five years of free maintenance. It has now scaled that back to three years. GMC and Chevrolet vehicles once came with a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, but that changed with the 2016 model year. Now the powertrain warranty is good for only 60,000 miles. Warranty changes aren't retroactive, however. Whatever coverage was in force for your car's model year will apply if you need repairs or service covered by the warranty. RANGE OF COVERAGE Starting with the 2018 model year, Volkswagen offers a six-year or 72,000-mile basic warranty. This coverage effectively doubled the warranty from the prior model years and is the longest-lasting among all brands. The shortest basic warranty currently is three years or 36,000 miles, and you'll find it on vehicles from Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota, for example. Makers including Acura, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Fiat, Mercedes-Benz and Mini offer four-year or 50,000-mile basic warranties. A handful, including Genesis, Hyundai, Jaguar and Kia, offer five-year or 60,000-mile basic coverage. ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE Roadside assistance is part of nearly every new-car warranty and lasts as long, if not longer, than the basic warranty. Not so for Toyota, however; its roadside coverage lasts just two years, even though the warranty is for three. EXTRA COVERAGE FOR EV AND HYBRID BATTERIES Batteries are critical to the operation of electric vehicles or hybrid cars and are expensive to replace. A Nissan Leaf battery costs $5,000, for example. Battery components are not part of the basic warranty, but there's good news: Under federal emissions regulations, EV and hybrid batteries must be warrantied for at least eight years or 100,000 miles. This coverage is fully transferable to all subsequent owners. 'GOODWILL' REPAIR Imagine that an expensive part breaks on your vehicle and your warranty has just expired. Normally, you'd have to pay up. But if the dealership service manager approves it, you can get a one-time exemption. This goodwill gesture is entirely at the discretion of your local dealership service department. But if you have a track record of having the maintenance performed there and ask nicely, you'll increase your chances of approval.

1555,"TOKYO (AP) — Tatsuro Toyoda, the former Toyota Motor Corp. president who led the company's climb to become one of the world's top automakers, has died. He was 88. Toyoda, a son of the company's founder, died Dec. 30 of pneumonia, the Japanese automaker said Saturday. Toyoda, the automaker's seventh president, stepped down from the position in 1995, while continuing in other posts, such as adviser, a title he held until his death. He was instrumental in setting up the California joint venture with U.S. rival General Motors called NUMMI, or New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., which began production in 1984. At that time, it was heralded as a pioneer in international collaborations in the industry. With a career focused on international operations, Toyoda served as NUMMI's first president, and is known for his efforts to bring together Toyota's corporate culture of super-efficiency, teamwork and empowering workers with American culture, including introducing a new style of labor-management relations. Toyoda's father, Kiichiro Toyoda, founded the company. His brother Shoichiro Toyoda, whom he succeeded as president, is current President Akio Toyoda's father. When Tatsuro Toyoda handed the helm to an executive outside the Toyota family, there was speculation he may be the last Toyoda family member to lead the company. But Akio defied skeptics to become president in 2009, underlining the family's legacy for the automaker. The rural house that marks the automaker's humble beginnings serves as a monument today. Toyota employees still repeat the sayings handed down by the family leaders about hard work and a hands-on approach. The company name is spelled and pronounced with a ""T,"" instead of the ""D'' as in the family name, because it was considered to bring luck, according to fortune-telling. Born in 1929, Tatsuro Toyoda was a graduate of the prestigious University of Tokyo, earning a degree in mechanical engineering. In 1953, he joined Toyota, which now makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, and rivals Volkswagen AG, General Motors and the Renault-Nissan alliance as a top automaker in annual global vehicle sales. Toyoda earned an MBA in 1958 from New York University, where he studied under quality-control expert W. Edwards Deming, an American credited with influencing Japanese manufacturing and helping develop its reputation for quality. A memorial service with family members was held for Toyoda, but a bigger farewell is being planned, according to the automaker. He is survived by his wife, Ayako Toyoda, but details on other family members were not immediately available. ____ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at Her work can be found at",40,45,Auto Brand,464
1568,"DETROIT (AP) — Every workday, about 7,400 trucks mostly loaded with automotive parts rumble across the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit and Canada, at times snarling traffic along the busy corridor. But if President Donald Trump delivers on threats to slap 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles and components, there will be far fewer big rigs heading to factories that are now humming close to capacity on both sides of the border. The tariff threat could be a negotiating ploy to restart stalled talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. But it also could be real, since the administration already has imposed duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports, as well as steel and aluminum from China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Tariffs against China include some autos and parts but if those spread to Canada and Mexico, the impact will be far larger because auto manufacturing has been integrated between the three countries for nearly a quarter century. The Commerce Department said in a statement last week that it ""has just launched its investigation into whether imports of auto and auto parts threaten to impair the national security. That investigation, which has only just begun, will inform recommendations to the president for action or inaction."" If the wider auto tariffs are imposed, industry experts say they will disrupt a decades-old symbiotic parts supply chain, raise vehicle prices, cut new-vehicle sales, cost jobs in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and even slow related sectors of the economy. ""It seems like it is going to be so devastating that I can't imagine that they're actually going to do it,"" said Kristen Dziczek, vice president of labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. Trump, who was sniping on Twitter at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after a contentious economic summit of the Group of Seven earlier this month, told the Commerce Department to look at national security reasons to justify tariffs with hopes of bringing factory jobs to the U.S. He tweeted that the administration would ""look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!"" But experts predict the tariffs likely would do the opposite, slowing the economy as other countries retaliate. Here's what they say is likely to happen: AUTO PRICES RISE, SALES FALL The tariffs would be charged on parts and assembled autos. Canada, Mexico and others would likely retaliate with duties, and automakers won't be able to absorb all of the increases. So they will have to raise prices. Imported parts, which all cars and trucks have, will cost more, further raising costs. ""We're all going to pay a lot more for vehicles,"" said Tim Galbraith, sales manager of Cavalier tool and manufacturing in Windsor, Ontario, near Detroit, maker of steel molds used to produce plastic auto parts. About 44 percent of the 17.2 million new vehicles sold last year in the U.S. were imported from other countries, and half of those came from Canada and Mexico. All have parts from outside the U.S., sometimes as much as 40 percent. Based on the 24-year-old NAFTA, automakers and suppliers constantly ship fully assembled vehicles as well as engines, transmissions and thousands of small widgets across both U.S. borders. Parts also come from China and other countries. It's difficult to determine how large any price increases would be. But some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that a Chevrolet Equinox small SUV made in Canada would cost about $5,250 more in the U.S. if General Motors doesn't eat part of it. That's based on an average price of $30,000 in the U.S. for the hot-selling Equinox, made primarily in Ingersoll, Ontario. Tariffs are charged on the manufacturing cost, which is about 70 percent of the sales price. Toyota's RAV4, a main Equinox competitor and the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that's not a pickup truck, also is made in Canada and would face the same duties. ""An import tariff would hurt consumers the most since it would increase the costs of vehicles and parts,"" Toyota said in a statement. Honda's CR-V, another small SUV, is made in Ohio and would be exempt from the tariff on assembled vehicles, so it would have a price advantage. But about one-quarter of its parts come from other countries. That would force Honda to raise its price too, said Dziczek. With higher prices, many people will either keep current vehicles or buy used ones. Jeff Schuster, senior vice president LMC Automotive, expects U.S. new-vehicle sales would fall 1 million to 2 million per year if tariffs are imposed. Since U.S. auto factories making popular models are running near capacity, automakers couldn't do much in the short run to build more vehicles in the U.S. and avoid the tariff, Schuster said. JOBS LOST As sales fall, auto and parts makers would need to cut costs by laying off workers. Mexico and Canada would be hit first, but since they import parts from the U.S., component makers domestically also would have to cut. For instance, the RAV4's engines are made in Alabama and transmissions in West Virginia. If sales drop, those factories wouldn't need as many workers. On the assembly line at the Ontario Equinox factory, the 2,400 workers are worried about the escalating dispute, said Joe Graves, the union president. ""I don't really see how one individual can change everything that was put in place over decades,"" Graves said of Trump. ""It does cause a lot of uncertainty and instability with our members."" As sales slump, dealers who sell imported cars would lay off workers, too. The pro-free trade Peterson Institute predicted that if other countries impose tariffs, U.S. auto production would fall 4 percent, costing 624,000 U.S. jobs in about one-to-three years. Other sectors of the economy would also be hit because autos touch nearly all manufacturing, said Dan Ujczo, a trade lawyer in Columbus, Ohio. Tariffs would ""be a shock wave through the economy. And that will be a red line for Congress to step in and do something,"" he predicted. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries would likely hit U.S. agriculture and other businesses, curtailing exports and also costing jobs, said Dziczek. Companies with price advantages due to the tariffs may increase U.S. production, and that could bring more jobs. But Schuster and others expect they would raise production with the existing workforce. Although Trump would like to see auto and parts production relocated to the U.S., experts say such moves are not likely. It would take several years and billions of dollars to plan and build new plants, which companies would be reluctant to do without knowing the tariffs are permanent. It's possible the next president could undo the tariffs, and the industry likely would wait for that, Dziczek said. ____ Frank Bajak in Boston and Chris Rugaber and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",3789,3794,Auto Brand,465
1576,"MILAN (AP) — Car sales in Europe topped the 15-million mark for the first time in a decade in 2017, the fourth straight year of higher registrations, the association of European carmakers said Wednesday. Registrations of new cars were up 3.4 percent from 14.6 million in 2016, said the association, ACEA. That brings sales to the highest level since before a record-long six-year slump started in 2007. Most major carmakers registered gains, as did four of the top five markets. Only Britain shrank, ceding 6-percent of the market on the heels of the vote to leave the European Union. The southern European nations of Italy and Spain, hardest hit by the six-year crisis, tallied the strongest gains, nearing 8 percent, followed by economic powerhouses France at nearly 5 percent and Germany at nearly 3 percent. Mass-market carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen expanded by 28 percent to over 1.8 million vehicles, thanks to the takeover of Opel from General Motors. Volkswagen remained the No. 1 automaker in the European market, increasing a modest 2.3 percent to 3.5 million vehicles even while the nameplate Volkswagen brand and luxury Audi marquee contracted slightly. Among premium carmakers, Alfa Romeo sales leaped 29 percent to 85,691, the largest increase of any brand, on sales of the Giulia sedan and Stelvio SUV. Daimler's sales grew by 5 percent to 992,528 vehicles while the BMW group trailed the market with a modest 1-percent gain. Toyota sales were up 12 percent, but the Japanese carmaker, which is one of the top-sellers globally, still hasn't hit its one-time goal of 5 percent European market share, falling shy at 4.6 percent.

SUPREME COURT-UNION FEES Justices take up critical challenge to public sector unions WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that could deal a painful financial blow to organized labor. All eyes will be on Justice Neil Gorsuch Monday when the court takes up a challenge to an Illinois law that allows unions representing government employees to collect fees from workers who choose not to join. The unions say the outcome could affect more than 5 million government workers in 24 states and the District of Columbia. The court split 4-4 the last time it considered the issue in 2016. Gorsuch joined the court in April and has yet to weigh in on union fees. Organized labor is a big supporter of Democratic candidates and interests. Unions strongly opposed Gorsuch's nomination by President Donald Trump. Illinois government employee Mark Janus says he has a constitutional right not to contribute anything to a union with which he disagrees. Janus and the conservative interests that back him contend that everything unions representing public employees do is political, including contract negotiations. The Trump administration is supporting Janus in his effort to persuade the court to overturn its 1977 ruling allowing states to require fair share fees for government employees. The unions argue that so-called fair share fees pay for collective bargaining and other work the union does on behalf of all employees, not just its members. People can't be compelled to contribute to unions' political activities. The American Civil Liberties Union is on the unions' side against an individual's free speech claims. ACLU Legal Director David Cole said fair share fees do not violate nonunion workers' rights. Labor leaders fear that not only would workers who don't belong to a union stop paying fees, but that some union members might decide to stop paying dues if they could in essence get the union's representation for free. TRANSPORTATION-SAFETY RULES AP Review: Trump's red tape cuts slice into safety rules WASHINGTON (AP) — On a clear, dry June evening in 2015, cars and trucks rolled slowly in a herky-jerky backup ahead of an Interstate 75 construction zone in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Barreling toward them: an 18-ton tractor-trailer going about 80 mph. Despite multiple signs warning of slow traffic, the driver, with little or no braking, bashed into eight vehicles before coming to a stop about 1½ football fields away. Six people died in the mangled wreck and four more were hurt. The driver was convicted of vehicular homicide and other charges last month. In response to this and similar crashes, the government in 2016 proposed requiring that new heavy trucks have potentially life-saving software that would electronically limit speeds. But now, like many other safety rules in the works before President Donald Trump took office, it has been delayed indefinitely by the Transportation Department as part of a sweeping retreat from regulations that the president says slow the economy. An Associated Press review of the department's rulemaking activities in Trump's first year in office shows at least a dozen safety rules that were under development or already adopted have been repealed, withdrawn, delayed or put on the back burner. In most cases, those rules are opposed by powerful industries. And the political appointees running the agencies that write the rules often come from the industries they regulate. Meanwhile, there have been no significant new safety rules adopted over the same period. BUSINESS ECONOMISTS SURVEY Most in survey see US fiscal policy as too aggressive WASHINGTON (AP) — A majority of business economists now view the government's tax and spending policy as moving too aggressively to stimulate economic growth, setting up a potential increase in the deficit in the coming years, a new survey shows. That view emerged from the latest economic policy survey by the National Association for Business Economics, polling 211 members at companies and industry groups. The survey by NABE, a professional association for business economists, academics and others who use economics in the workplace, was released Monday. The 52 percent of economists who consider the government's fiscal policy ""too stimulative"" compares with only 20 percent in August, in the previous economic policy survey. This time, 37 percent of respondents judged tax and spending policy as ""about right,"" down from 46 percent in August. By contrast, the economists are more supportive of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy: more than 6 in 10 have pegged it as ""about right."" That's the highest percentage in eight years, according to NABE. The NABE economists, reflecting the prevailing view of corporate America, continue to have a strong preference for more conservative fiscal policy in the long run.

1640,"It's true that cars with a manual transmission are a dying breed. According to Edmunds research, manual-equipped vehicles make up less than 3 percent of current U.S. car sales. Automakers are making automatic transmissions standard because the latest ones return better fuel economy, and they shift quicker and smoother than even the best manual transmissions. For some drivers, though, pushing a clutch pedal and rowing your gears are among the most satisfying parts of the driving experience. For others, nostalgia explains the attraction. If you're in either camp, know that some mainstream cars are available with a manual. We've rounded up some of our favorites from a variety of vehicle classes. One of the most appealing sedans on the market is the redesigned 2018 Honda Accord. The Accord boasts a high-quality cabin, generous cargo space, high-tech options and engaging performance. Under the hood is one of two available engines: a 1.5-liter four-cylinder and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both are turbocharged and available with a six-speed manual transmission as a no-cost option on the Sport trim level. Manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for the 2018 Accord Sport with the 1.5-liter engine: $25,780 plus $890 destination With its fair share of style and a likable powertrain, the Mazda 6 is another excellent midsize sedan that offers a manual transmission. You can only get it on the Mazda 6's base Sport and midlevel Touring trims, but even those trim levels provide many desirable features. Other highlights for the Mazda 6 include pleasing power from its four-cylinder engine, a fun-to-drive nature and a classy-looking cabin. A 2018 Mazda 6 is coming this spring that offers similar qualities with updated styling and technology. MSRP for the 2017 Mazda 6 Touring: $24,195 plus $890 destination The new 2018 Jeep Wrangler has been vastly improved with this year's redesign. For now, you can only get the manual with the 3.6-liter V6, but you can put that powertrain package in either the two- or the four-door Wrangler. You can also choose all sorts of options to go along with it. Thanks to high ground clearance, big tires and four-wheel drive, the Wrangler is one of the most capable off-road vehicles on the road today. Yet this new model is also more practical and comfortable than ever before. MSRP for the four-door 2018 Wrangler Unlimited Sport S: $33,695 plus $1,195 destination For a more luxurious experience, there's the 2018 Audi A4. A manual transmission is available in all three of the A4's trim levels:, Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. And it is paired to a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive. As we've come to expect from Audi in recent years, the interior of the A4 has a user-friendly design, comfortable seats and excellent cabin materials. It's a no-brainer if you're looking for an upscale sedan with three pedals. MSRP  for the 2018 A4 Premium: $40,500 plus $975 destination A direct competitor of the A4 is the perennial luxury sedan powerhouse known as the BMW 3 Series. Unlike the Audi, which comes with only all-wheel drive when you opt for a manual, the BMW offers a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive as well as four-cylinder or six-cylinder power to go with the manual transmission. From the stylish exterior to the impeccable interior build quality and the modern tech, there's a lot to like about the 3 Series sedan. MSRP for the 2018 BMW 340i xDrive sedan: $50,950 plus $995 destination HONORABLE MENTIONS Many budget-oriented vehicles offer a manual transmission. Worth checking out are Honda's Civic and HR-V crossover SUV, Kia's Soul hatchback and Toyota's Corolla iM hatchback. Of course, there are many high-performance vehicles that you can get today with a stick shift. In the compact category, check out the Ford Focus ST or RS, the Honda Civic Type R, the Mazda MX-5 Miata, the Mini Cooper Hardtop, the Subaru WRX and the Volkswagen Golf GTI. Detroit's muscle cars are keeping up tradition, too: The Chevrolet Camaro, the Dodge Challenger and the Ford Mustang all still have manuals. Don't bother with Ferrari, though. Nothing coming from Maranello, Italy, has a clutch pedal anymore. EDMUNDS SAYS: If you're looking for a car with a manual transmission, you don't have to look far. Sedans, SUVs, luxury cars, small hatchbacks and sports cars all have something to offer in the manual-transmission category. Just try not to stall yours when you pull away from the dealer lot. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

AUSTRALIA-ASEAN Southeast Asian leaders gather for first Australia summit CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Southeast Asian leaders started gathering Friday for their first summit in Australia as the regional neighbors look for closer economic and security links and the host prime minister warned against trade protectionism. The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, rarely meet outside their 10 member nations and the weekend summit in Sydney has caught the attention of protesters angered by human rights abuses in Southeast Asia. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been criticized for welcoming some of the leaders to his hometown, including Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who have been singled out by protesters. But Turnbull is looking at ASEAN for its potential to drive free trade in the Indo-Pacific region in a way that the major economies, the United States and China, cannot without creating suspicion and division. The dual themes of the Sydney summit are security and prosperity, with the threat to both posed by North Korea high on the agenda. FOR-PROFITS-STUDENT LOANS Corinthian students begin receiving partial relief notices WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Education has begun notifying some former Corinthian Colleges students that it will forgive only one-half or less of their federal student loans, even though the students were defrauded by the now-defunct schools, the Associated Press has learned. The action is part of the Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' push to ease regulations governing for-profit schools. DeVos says she wants to protect taxpayers' money, but critics say that the Trump administration has deep ties to for-profit colleges and is putting industry interests ahead of students. Two weeks ago, Sarah Dieffenbacher, a California health care worker, received a letter saying the agency would only discharge 50 percent of her student loans. The mother of four had borrowed about $67,000 to train as a paralegal at Everest college in Ontario, California, part of the Corinthian chain, but was unable to land a single job in the field. In her first interview since receiving the agency's decision, Dieffenbacher told the AP Thursday that the decision was utterly unfair. Alec Harris, Dieffenbacher's attorney with the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University said: ""There is no justification for making Sarah and others pay for having been cheated. The Department's actions are incoherent and vindictive."" Department press secretary Liz Hill would not comment on Dieffenbacher's specific case and referred the AP to an earlier statement from DeVos. The secretary announced in December that she was breaking with the Obama administration's practice of fully wiping out the loans of defrauded for-profit students and would grant some only partial relief. WYNN RESORTS-SETTLEMENT Stockholders agreement involving Steve Wynn, ex-wife invalid LAS VEGAS (AP) — An agreement involving embattled casino mogul Steve Wynn and his ex-wife that has kept her from controlling her stock in Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts has been deemed invalid, opening the possibility for each to sell their shares. A state judge in Las Vegas on Wednesday signed off on a stipulation and order stating that the 2010 stockholders agreement is no longer enforceable. It is the latest in a series of recent moves in a civil case that has been in litigation for years. Elaine Wynn was granted almost half of Steve Wynn's ownership in the company as part of their divorce in 2010. The stockholders agreement stipulated they would vote jointly on company matters, including stock sale, but she filed court documents in 2016 to get control of her shares after she was voted off the Wynn Resorts' board of directors. Elaine Wynn in court records in 2016 said she agreed in 2010 to let Steve Wynn control her stock ""to help her partner of 41 years and the father of her children"" protect Wynn Resorts and their mutual interests from one-time business partner Kazuo Okada and Aruze USA Inc., a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Universal Entertainment Corp. She argued that the document was no longer needed because the company in 2012 had redeemed the shares of Aruze, another party to the shareholders agreement. A $2.4 billion settlement announced last week between Wynn Resorts and Universal over the forced redemption of shares in 2012 paved the way for the stockholders agreement to be deemed invalid Wednesday. FORD-PRODUCT REVAMP Ford pledges to revamp aging product line, add SUVs, by 2020 DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford, with a sagging U.S. market share and one of the oldest vehicle lineups in the industry, is promising to revamp three-quarters of its models in the next two years. Much of the emphasis will be on refreshing or revamping the entire lineup of SUVs while adding gas-electric hybrid powertrains, two new off-road SUVs and two new trucks. It's all part of the larger plan to prepare the company for the future by cutting costs, increasing the number of common parts and feeding a long-starved product lineup. The move, detailed at a presentation on Thursday at Ford's product development center in Dearborn, Michigan, comes at a time when Ford's aging lineup has had trouble appealing to U.S. customers. In the past five years the company's market share has fallen over 2 percentage points to 14.4 percent so far this year. Last year its market share rose 0.1 percentage point. Included in the hybrid plan is one for the F-150 pickup, the top-selling vehicle in America, that will offer increased towing power and an on-board generator. Ford pledged to be the hybrid sales leader, unseating Toyota in the U.S. by 2021. CEO Jim Hackett also promised to speed up new product development in the future.

1729,"DETROIT (AP) — The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opened to the press this week with one big question hanging in the air: How will autonomous vehicles change the industry? The answer is still unclear. In the meantime, automakers continue to put out new vehicles of all shapes and sizes, including small cars, SUVs and the all-mighty pickup truck, which dominated the show. All will be on display when the show opens to the public Saturday, with a charity preview on Friday night. Here are five things we learned from the preview this week: TRUCKS ARE KING Pickups are the most popular vehicles in the U.S., and trucks unveiled at the show make clear that will continue for a long time. General Motors spent heavily to update its top-selling Chevrolet Silverado pickup, cutting up to 450 pounds of weight by using more aluminum and lighter high-strength steel. The truck also gets two new V8 engines that can run on one to eight cylinders depending on how much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler's Ram also got big updates, losing more than 200 pounds and giving it a gas-electric hybrid engine option. Both the Silverado and Ram were given more athletic stances and meaner looks. Ford added a diesel engine to its F-150 and rolled out the midsize Ranger. Automakers turn big profits on large pickups. Sales rose nearly 6 percent last year to almost 2.4 million, even though total U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent. Ford's F-Series is the country's top-selling vehicle, followed by the Silverado and Ram. TAX REFORM BOOST? U.S. auto sales are likely to fall to around 16.7 million in 2018 from 17.2 million last year, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst with the car buying site Autotrader.com. But that would still make it one of the 10 best sales years in history, so the market remains strong. U.S. income tax code changes this year may stimulate new auto sales, but any increase likely will be offset by rising interest rates and the abundant supply of late-model used cars that pull buyers from new vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp.'s top North American executive says. North American CEO Jim Lentz expects a sales boost of 200,000 vehicles as tax cuts put more money in people's pockets. But the increase could be negated as rising rates keep some people on the sidelines, and some buyers opt for a lower-cost but nice off-lease used car. Tax cuts could boost pickup truck sales because businesses can write off the expenses immediately under the new code, Lentz said. But he expects luxury new-car sales to be flat this year even though tax rates were reduced for higher-income earners. Any decrease could be wiped out by caps on deductions for mortgage interest and local and state taxes in big luxury-car states such as New York and California, Lentz said. TRADE DEAL Many auto executives interviewed at the auto show say they're afraid the U.S. might pull out of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, but they can't prepare for it because they don't know what, if anything will replace it. In ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada, the Trump administration is seeking to ensure that more vehicles are made in America, among other changes. But Jim Lentz, Toyota's North American CEO, says ending the agreement would likely raise costs. That, in turn, would raise vehicle prices and cut demand, forcing manufacturing layoffs. It also would make the U.S. less competitive than the world's other manufacturing centers, he said. Ending the agreement also could force some suppliers to stop making parts. Charlie Chesbrough, the chief economist for Cox Automotive, said it's hard to imagine there will be much change in production, because automakers need a long lead time to act and they know the next president could reverse Trump's actions. But some automakers are already taking pre-emptive steps to show the administration they're willing to boost U.S. production. Fiat Chrysler said ahead of the auto show that it will move heavy duty truck production from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. HEDGING ON ROBOT CARS Automakers are hedging their bets when it comes to autonomous vehicles and whether they will someday cut into or even end personal car ownership. In interviews through the week, executives said they're preparing for a time when people hire self-driving ride services to get around instead of spending on personal vehicles. But they don't know just when that will take place, so they also must continue to spend millions to develop conventional vehicles as well. ""These proclamations that we hear about the advent of electrification and artificial intelligence ... are all things that, at best, are conjecture,"" said Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Although some companies plan to deploy driverless cars to carry passengers in coming months, Marchionne says it will take years for the vehicles to be in widespread use. Mark Reuss, General Motors' head of product development says he wishes he knew exactly when and where the switch would take place. But for now, GM and other companies have to be in both places. ""We can go either way and that agility is priceless,"" said Reuss. GOOD OLD DAYS Despite the new wheels on the show floor, one of the biggest hits is a 50-year-old Mustang GT fastback in need of a paint job. It was one of the original cars used in the 1968 film ""Bullitt,"" which put the Mustang on the map with a famous chase scene. Ford Motor Co. rolled it out to help celebrate a special ""Bullitt"" edition Mustang, which goes on sale this summer. The faded green car got a huge cheer when it rumbled onto the stage.",2034,2039,Auto Brand,433

TOP STORIES: TAX OVERHAUL-STATES CHERRY HILL, N.J. — State governments are considering lawsuits and tax structure changes in response to the federal overhaul.

Elsewhere, states are trying to determine whether the changes will bring them more revenue — and decide whether they should send that back to taxpayers. By Geoff Mulvihill. SENT: 1,100 words, photos. AP EXPLAINS-STATES RIGHTS Lawmakers and others in Democratic-learning states have been howling over the past year about actions by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that they say have undermined states' rights. That includes promoting concealed carry legislation and attacking sanctuary status for immigrants to this week's decisions on legalized marijuana and offshore oil drilling. But it wasn't too long ago that the shoe was on the other foot, with Republican states pushing back against the Obama administration's intrusions on issues such as transgender rights and environmental regulation. Promoting the constitutional protections for states' rights — outlined in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — has always been popular among politicians. But it also is situational.

31,"BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group and the biggest Chinese SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, announced a partnership Tuesday to produce electric MINI vehicles in China as global automakers ramp up development under pressure from Beijing. The companies said they signed an agreement Monday during an event in Berlin attended by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. BMW and Great Wall said their venture, Spotlight Automotive Ltd., also will make electrics for the Chinese partner's brand. Great Wall put total investment in the venture at 5.1 billion yuan ($770 million) and said it is aiming for annual production of 160,000 vehicles. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Other automakers including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. have announced similar plans with Chinese partners to produce dozens of electric models. Great Wall, headquartered in Baoding, southwest of Beijing, sells more than 1 million SUVs a year. ""With our joint approach, we can quickly scale up production and increase efficiency,"" said Klaus Frolich, a BMW board member, in a statement. MINI's first battery electric model is due to be produced at its main British factory in Oxford in 2019, according to BMW. China is BMW's biggest market. The Munich-based automaker said about 560,000 BMW brand vehicles were delivered to Chinese customers in 2017, more than its next two markets —  the United States and Germany — combined. China was MINI's fourth-largest market in 2017, with 35,000 vehicles delivered, the company said. The electrics venture with BMW is an important boost for Great Wall, which industry analysts warned would struggle to satisfy Beijing's sales quotas due to its fuel-guzzling vehicle lineup and had yet to announce any significant electric plans. ___ BMW Group: www.bmwgroup.com Great Wall Motors Co.: www.gwm-global.com",15,17,Auto Brand,475
41,"HELSINKI (AP) — Top European Union officials were going into a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday warning they are ready to put tariffs on $20 billion of American goods if he puts duties on car imports. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom will meet Trump in Washington to try to talk him out of imposing the auto tariffs, which would hurt the industry on both sides of the Atlantic and ratchet up trade tensions significantly. ""The aim of this visit is to cool down the situation and prevent an escalation of the trade conflict,"" Malmstrom told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in an interview. But she noted that if the U.S. proceeds with the duties, the EU is ready to respond. It will impose new tariffs on a range of U.S. products, including agricultural and high-tech products and machinery. Trump has repeatedly called the EU - which includes many of the U.S.'s oldest and most committed allies - an unfair trading partner and even labeled it a ""foe."" His administration this year imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, drawing retaliation from the EU on a series of U.S. goods. But those tariffs covered about $3 billion in goods and would pale in comparison with possible 25 percent tariffs on imports of cars, trucks and auto parts. It is unclear what Trump's approach will be in the talks. After tweeting that ""Tariffs are the greatest!"" he suggested hours later in another post that ""both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies!"" The EU's budget chief, Guenther Oettinger, said the EU was prepared to discuss lowering and restructuring all tariffs for all products. ""We want to avoid a further escalation of the trade dispute (into) a trade war,"" Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. ""We have good arguments, clear numbers and we have ideas, too."" ""Whether these will help, nobody knows. But not to try, not to fly over there for the meeting, would have been the wrong path."" Auto tariffs would be particularly painful for Germany, where the industry is huge and has long been the symbol of postwar wealth. And it is not just Europeans opposing these tariffs, but American companies as well. The duties would increase the cost of many components that American manufacturers import and use in making cars. Ultimately, that will make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers. EU has a huge stake in the U.S. industry, where European companies produce almost 3 million cars a year, accounting for over a quarter of production in the United States. The biggest exporter of U.S.-made cars is a German company — BMW, through its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. German producers and supplies employ more than 118,000 people at about 300 plants and manufacture more than 800,000 vehicles per year in the U.S. — with more than half of the cars being exported, according to figures provided by the German automotive industry. ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.",2614,2616,Auto Brand,476

74,"WALL STREET Stocks post gains for fourth straight day NEW YORK (AP) — Technology and energy companies are leading stocks higher on Wall Street, putting the market on track for its fourth gain in a row. PepsiCo rose 3 percent after its earnings came in ahead of analysts' expectations. The market has posted gains over the last several days following a strong jobs report and hopes that companies will report solid second-quarter results in the coming weeks. JOB OPENINGS US job openings slip in May, as quits reach 17-year high WASHINGTON (AP) — Businesses advertised fewer jobs in May than the previous month, but the tally of open positions outnumbered the ranks of the unemployed for only the second time in the past two decades. The Labor Department also says the proportion of workers quitting their jobs reached the highest level since April 2001. Quits are seen as a positive sign that workers are confident they can find another job. Most people who quit do so for higher-paying positions. The figures reflect a strong job market driven by optimistic employers seeking to expand their workforces. Last week's jobs report showed that businesses hired workers at a healthy pace and the unemployment rate remained very low, at 4 percent. There were 6.64 million available jobs in May, but just 6 million unemployed people. CHINA-TARIFFS China announces anti-dumping duties BEIJING (AP) — China has stepped up action against some U.S. goods by announcing anti-dumping duties on raw materials used in making optical fibers.

It said Corning was among the companies that would be affected by the higher duties. TRUMP-CLIMATE PLAN Trump replacement for Obama climate plan moves forward BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Trump administration is advancing its plan to replace the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts against global warming with a new rule expected to be friendlier to the coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency said it sent the new rule to the White House for review on Monday. The document itself was not released. The move coincided with former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler's first day at the helm of the EPA following last week's resignation of Administrator Scott Pruitt. Obama sought to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, largely by reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants. Under Trump, the EPA declared the old rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. CHINA-TESLA Tesla announces deal for Shanghai factory UNDATED (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla says it will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai. Tesla says an agreement signed Tuesday with a Shanghai city government agency calls for construction to start in the near future. It says production would begin three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. The announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese trade tensions and follows Beijing's decision in April to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through joint ventures with local partners. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market. Automakers are investing heavily to develop models to appeal to local customers. CHINA-BMW-ELECTRIC MINI BMW to make electric MINIs in China with Great Wall Motor BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group and China's biggest SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, have announced a partnership to produce electric MINI vehicles in China. Tuesday's announcement comes as automakers pour billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology, under pressure from Beijing to accelerate development. BMW and Great Wall said the venture also will produce electric vehicles under the Chinese partner's brand. Other automakers including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. have announced similar plans with local partners to produce dozens of electric models for China. ISRAEL-LUNAR MISSION Israeli company plans lunar landing next year YEHUD, Israel (AP) — An Israeli company says it will soon attempt to become the first private entity to land a spacecraft on the moon. SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries plan to launch their unmanned module in December, the teams announced Tuesday. If it succeeds, Israel will become the fourth country to land on the moon, after the U.S., the Soviet Union and China. The $95 million project, largely funded by South African-Israeli billionaire Morris Kahn and other donors, aims to land on the moon on Feb. 13. Kahn said if they pull off the moonshot it would be ""a tremendous achievement."" SpaceIL originally vied for Google's Lunar Xprize, but the $20 million competition was scrapped in March after none of the companies met the deadline. CUBA-PRIVATE-BUSINESS Cuba unfreezing growth of private tourism businesses HAVANA (AP) — The Cuban government will allow new restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and transportation businesses by the end of the year, reopening the most vibrant sectors of the private economy after freezing growth for more than a year. The government is unveiling a set of new regulations meant to control the growth of tourism-related private businesses and collect more tax revenue from them. Private restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts boomed after U.S.-Cuba normalization in 2014 prompted rapid growth in tourism to Cuba. Tax evasion and purchase of stolen state materials also boomed in the mostly cash-based private hospitality sector. Among other measures, the new regulations announced Tuesday require private businesses to move all their revenue through state-run bank accounts. Cuba froze new licenses for restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and other key business in August 2017.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES-PEANUTS Ending a long tradition, Southwest will stop serving peanuts UNDATED (AP) — Southwest Airlines will stop giving away peanuts on flights next month, ending a tradition that goes back decades. The airline said Tuesday it was pulling peanuts from all flights because of concern for passengers with peanut allergies. They will be replaced by pretzels and, on some longer flights, other free snacks. Southwest says the decision follows months of deliberation and isn't tied to any particular incident involving passengers with allergies. No snack is more closely identified with a U.S. airline. Over the years, Southwest used the humble legume in marketing campaigns. A blog on its website is called Nuts About Southwest. Some of Southwest's other early quirks, like dressing flight attendants in hot pants, went out decades ago, but the peanuts survived. Until now.",3410,3412,Auto Brand,478
84,"GENEVA (AP) — This year's Geneva auto show is crowded with new cars flaunting electric and autonomous technologies meant to help unclog city streets and fight global warming and air pollution. That didn't stop carmakers from offering their traditional crowd-pleasers: ostentatious displays of overweening horsepower in sleek, fossil-fuel burning and very expensive sports cars. The contrast isn't unusual when it comes to auto shows but it was particularly striking this year, as automakers push to get ahead of expected shifts toward electric and autonomous vehicles — while high-end cars remain a profitable business. French automaker Renault unveiled its futuristic and funky EZ-Go, a six-seat self-driving electric vehicle that aims to bridge public and private transportation needs, with options like on-demand pickup, like by a taxi. It features a rooftop opening that allows passengers to enter by a ramp for easy access. Renault Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore called it an ""urban, 'robo-vehicle' electric concept that can be tailored for public and private services."" Mercedes-Benz rolled out its EQA concept car, a compact battery electric vehicle with a virtual radiator that changes appearance depending on the selected driving program. Volkswagen showed off its I.D. Vizzion large electric sedan, shown in an autonomous version without a steering wheel, calling it a ""smart device on wheels."" Companies have invested billions in electric cars even though they still appeal to relatively few buyers. Carmakers are positioning themselves for a future tipping point in which longer battery range, more places to charge, and falling costs make electrics as attractive as conventional vehicles. Driverless cars, meanwhile, remain in the testing phase. Analysts at IHS Market forecast that autonomous cars will have their first year of significant volume sales in 2021. To explain their appeal, BMW CEO Harald Krueger used the example of a Chinese customer who currently spends 30 days out of the year sitting in traffic jams. ""If I can give him as a gift 28 days through autonomous driving, so that he can take a break, listen to music, or maybe look after email, then that is a comfort factor that the customer will want to have,"" Krueger told journalists. ""The company that doesn't offer that will be the one that doesn't sell the car,"" he said. Internal combustion engines and cars offering an exciting experience for real human drivers remained very much in evidence, however. Luxury sports car maker McLaren showed off its 211-mph (340 kph) Senna, named after the driver Ayrton Senna. The car is styled like a race car with prominent intakes and a rear spoiler. The production run of 500 is sold out at the factory, at a starting price of at 750,000 pounds, or about $1 million at current exchange rates. Ferrari offered the curvaceous 488 Pista, whose 710 horsepower engine, fed by large rear air intakes, has been fine tuned to emit a ""unique and unmistakable"" roar as the car accelerates. Italian designer Zagato displayed the IsoRivolta Vision Gran Turismo in a mock-up version. The vehicle has a carbon-fiber body with giant arched wheel wells and a dark glass cockpit for two. The five expected production models should sell for north of 1.5 million euros ($1.86 million) each. The show opened to journalists Tuesday and Wednesday. It opens to the public Thursday and runs through March 18.",1910,1912,Auto Brand,479

108,"Ten years ago, you could count on one hand the number of hybrid models available from luxury automakers. Today, there are 24 and more on the way. It turns out there's a good reason for the popularity of hybrid powertrains in luxury cars, and it's not just fuel economy. Hybrids are quiet, improve mileage range and can deliver strong acceleration, especially from a stop. Many luxury automakers have seized on those attributes and have made hybrid versions of premium models. But each automaker takes a different approach. Hybrids essentially marry electric motors to a conventional engine, relieving the engine of some of the propulsion burden and recovering energy when you slow down. This energy is stored in a battery to be used the next time you need to accelerate. It's not that simple, however, since the hybrid hardware adds weight, takes up space and increases cost. Still, hybrids have steadily become better over the years. Plug-in hybrids have ports and are a stepping stone to a pure battery-only electric vehicle, providing several miles of largely all-electric driving. When the battery runs low, these powertrains revert to traditional hybrid operation, which draws more heavily from the gasoline engine. If you're diligent about plugging in and going easy on the accelerator, short trips in a plug-in hybrid can use surprisingly little fuel. Here is a rundown of what you can expect if you're shopping for a luxury hybrid: LEXUS Lexus offers a hybrid version for almost every model it sells, from its small SUV to its premier coupes and sedans. The midsize sedan, the sport coupe and the SUV — all hybrid versions of their conventional siblings — use a six-cylinder engine that's bolstered by battery-fed electric motors. They aren't plug-ins, so these hybrids do all the hybrid-related thinking for the driver and ask nothing in return. They do their best work around town, boosting low-end acceleration, adding quietness and maximizing fuel economy. MERCEDES-BENZ Mercedes-Benz offers plug-in hybrid versions of its SUV and sedan, both of which offer more power than any of their respective stablemates except for the high-performance AMG-badged vehicles. The plug-in hybrid and the plug-in hybrid are also the most efficient versions of each model, though you have to pay upfront for the privilege. To that end, the automaker is deploying 48-volt ""mild hybrid"" tech for its latest six-cylinder models. These vehicles won't be badged as hybrids, but the guts are all there, albeit in a smaller, less expensive form. PORSCHE Porsche goes from mild to wild in the six hybrid variants of the sedan. Topping the list is the that delivers a bruising 680 horsepower. It's one of the quickest cars on the road, yet it can also travel about 15 miles on battery power alone. Meanwhile, the electric hardware adds 95 horsepower to its gasoline V6 and enhances its ability to go off-road — electric motors allow for precise control when you're crawling over tricky terrain. BMW BMW has a strong hybrid presence, too, offering plug-in hybrid versions of three of its sedans —  the , the and the — and its largest SUV, the . The German automaker takes an atypical strategy, with the hybrid versions positioned somewhat lower pricewise in their respective model lineups. For instance, the sticker price of the hybrid 530e iPerformance starts at the same price as the least expensive 5 Series you can buy, the 530i, and matches its acceleration from 0 to 60 mph. VOLVO Volvo's approach toward hybridization is to underpin models with the same plug-in hybrid powertrain. The sedan, the SUV and the SUV all sport a turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder engine that drives the front wheels only while the electric motor drives the rear wheels. Each one is the most powerful and fuel-efficient — and the most expensive — version in their respective ranges. CADILLAC American automakers don't have as comprehensive a presence in premium luxury hybrids as others. Cadillac's Plug-In sedan is the most significant, and it offers a pleasing mix of luxury, power and electric-only driving range. The brand used to offer the ELR, which was essentially a restyled Chevrolet Volt, but buyers balked at the price and Cadillac discontinued it. It serves as a cautionary tale that hybrid-ness alone isn't enough to secure success in the luxury segment. EDMUNDS SAYS: Hybrid powertrains make a lot of sense for premium luxury cars thanks to the power, range, and quieter driving experience they can provide. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

122,"DETROIT (AP) — At the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains sits a sprawling factory that has become an unlikely victim in the escalating trade fight between the U.S. and China. The plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina, is owned by German automaker BMW, and it exports more vehicles to China than any other auto factory in America. The 6 million-square-foot plant makes luxury sport utility vehicles, which are coveted by affluent Chinese buyers for their German prestige and reliability that's better than Chinese domestic brands. One in every four SUVs that comes off its assembly lines is shipped to China. Now those 87,000 vehicles could be subject to extra tariffs that could add tens of thousands of Chinese yuan to their already lofty prices. The trade dispute between the U.S. and China intensified last week, when the Trump administration released its list of imports from China worth $50 billion on which it would impose 25-percent tariffs as punishment for China's alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property. China retaliated with its own threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. products, including autos. In a move aimed at defusing the conflict, China President Xi Jinping on Tuesday indicated his country would make concessions, promising to cut auto import taxes and improve intellectual property protection but offering no specifics. China has promised similar changes in the past but has not followed through. If both sides make good on tariff threats, German luxury automakers, rather than American companies, will be hit the hardest. American and Japanese automakers produce most of what they sell in China at factories located there. In addition to BMW's South Carolina factory, a Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, ships as many as 75,000 pricey GLS and GLE SUVs to China. Because the German vehicles — with leather seats, heated steering wheels, sunroofs and other goodies — command high prices in China, the current 25 percent tariff on autos shipped in from the U.S. doesn't seem that outrageous. However, if the tariff doubles to 50 percent of the manufacturing cost as China has threatened, the German vehicles could be priced out of the market, forcing the companies to make them in China or elsewhere. A BMW X5 large SUV, for example, starts at $57,200 in the U.S. The cost to manufacture a high-priced SUV is roughly 30 percent below the sticker price. At 25 percent, the tariff would be about $10,000 (63,020 yuan) on an X5 entering China. It would double to $20,000 (126,040 yuan) if the tariff doubles. The U.S. isn't as restrictive about cars coming into the country. Currently, there is a 2.5 percent tariff on imported autos and 25 percent on imported pickup trucks. Trump is proposing to hit all auto imports with a 25 percent tariff. In addition, Trump last week threatened to add $100 billion more in tariffs if China retaliates against the U.S. It's not clear yet what products that would cover. Realizing what's at stake, BMW put out a statement supporting free trade and warning that a conflict could hurt its factory, which exported 70 percent of the 371,000 SUVs it made last year to 123 countries. One third of the exports went to China. ""Free trade has made the success story of BMW Group in the U.S. possible,"" wrote Kenn Sparks, the company's chief U.S. spokesman. ""In our opinion, a further escalation of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China would be harmful for all stakeholders."" The plant started off making cars when it opened more than 23 years ago at a time when the SUV was starting to catch on in the U.S. BMW quickly spotted the trend and began building one SUV there. It shifted the whole plant to sport utilities by 2008 as Americans and then much of the world began falling for the high seating and roomy cargo area. When it opened in 1994 with an initial investment of $600 million, the plant had 2,000 workers, helping South Carolina diversify its employment from textiles to manufacturing. It now makes X3, X4, X5 and X6 SUVs there, growing into an economic powerhouse as BMW hired a total of 10,000 people and invested $8 billion. The factory also supports 40 parts supply companies in the state. One study found that the plant spurred more than 30,000 jobs in the state. But Kristen Dziczek, a vice president at industry think tank Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says a trade war with China could force BMW, Mercedes and others to rethink where they make vehicles, and that could cost jobs in the heart of Trump country. Spartanburg County, where the BMW plant is located, voted 63 percent for Trump in 2016. BMW wouldn't comment on jobs. Before the tariffs were floated, it had plans to start producing the X3 compact SUV at a Chinese factory. Even so, Sparks says the Spartanburg plant will make more X3s than it does now because of high demand in the U.S. Other auto producers that could suffer because of the tariffs threatened by China include Tesla, which a Barclay's analyst said gets about 12 percent of its revenue by exporting about 14,300 electric cars and SUVs from California to China. Ford also ships more than 50,000 vehicles, mostly from the luxury Lincoln brand, to China. But most of what it sells in China is made there in joint venture factories. Ironically, the 25 percent tariff that the U.S. is contemplating against China could cost some U.S. automakers money. General Motors exports about 37,000 Buick Envision SUVs from China to the U.S. They would be subject to a higher tariff, adding thousands to the vehicle's $34,000 sticker price. Ford plans to export what could be thousands of its Focus compact cars from China to the U.S. starting in 2019. At present, the U.S. is besting China in the auto export business. Companies shipped about 250,000 vehicles from the U.S. to China last year, and China sent about 25,000 to the U.S.  But Dziczek says that is rapidly changing with more production headed to China.",246,248,Auto Brand,485
133,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai under an agreement signed Tuesday, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that suggested the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production.",2680,2682,Auto Brand,486
148,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Volvo Cars opened its first plant in the U.S. on Wednesday in a much different trade environment than when it announced its expansion across the Atlantic three years ago. The Swedish automaker threw a glitzy party for the reveal of its redesigned S60 sedan, which will roll off a South Carolina assembly line this fall. All the cars will run on hybrid electric power, with no diesel engine options, in keeping with Volvo's promise to stop making newly designed cars powered solely by internal combustion engines. But looming over the celebration is President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy, with threats of tariffs that could disrupt the global car market. Trump was elected in 2016, a year after Volvo announced its $1.1 billion investment in Ridgeville, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) inland from the busy port in Charleston. Foreign automakers are one of Trump's favorite targets for extra charges on imports. Volvo executives said Wednesday they want to end all tariffs between the U.S. and Europe and China, where its parent, the Geely holding company, is based. But they said they're well aware that a sudden Trump decision could shift their global strategy in a moment. The company also makes cars in Sweden and China. ""We will export as many cars from this factory as we will import in the U.S.; Volvo will in three years' time have a neutral balance of trade. That is a good example of how trade with cars should work in an open and free economy,"" Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said. Sweden's ambassador to the U.S. publicly called on the dignitaries in the audience -- including U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the state's former governor, and Gov. Henry McMaster, who touts his friendship with Trump -- to remind the president how tariffs kill trade. ""A plant like this does not need it,"" Ambassador Karin Olofswdotter said. ""We are all a part of global value chains. That's what creates the jobs we have today. That's how the economy works."" Volvo, which livestreamed the ceremony, also called up more than a dozen of its nearly 1,500 employees already working at the plant to share their stories. Volvo plans to add the manufacture of its new XC90 SUV to the South Carolina plant starting in 2021, aiming to employ a total of 4,000 people and make 130,000 vehicles a year. Last year, Volvo became the first major automaker to publicly commit to using hybrid or all-electric engines in new car and SUV models by 2019. Volvo is looking at the kind of success BMW has had in South Carolina. The German automaker produced more than 370,000 vehicles at its Spartanburg plant in 2017, employing 10,000 people. That sparked a manufacturing renaissance in the state, accelerating a shift from textiles to car making. Trump's proposed tariffs on not just vehicles, but steel and aluminum too, seem to be targeting BMW and fellow German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, which makes vans at a plant near Charleston. But Olofswdotter said in today's modern, open world, any levies that target foreign countries hurt everyone. ""We should really work together to solve the world's problems,"" Olofswdotter said.",2499,2501,Auto Brand,487

BMW Korea Chairman Kim Hyo-joon said the German carmaker will fully cooperate with the transport ministry's investigation and complete emergency safety inspections of its vehicles by next week. More than 20 cases of BMW fires have been reported in South Korea, mostly in July. Images and videos of BMW sedans engulfed in smoke and gutted by fires caused alarm among drivers. Some parking lots reportedly refused to let in BMW drivers and other drivers said they were trying to avoid BMWs on the road. BMW said it found the cause of the engine fires was leaks in their exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers. That caused fires when vehicles were driven at high speeds for long periods of time. The company denied speculation that faulty software programs may be behind the fires. ""The root cause is hardware issues. This has nothing to do with software issues,"" Johann Ebenbichler, BMW's vice president for quality management, told reporters in German, interpreted by a translator. He also said the fire will only occur while the vehicles are being driven. ""I'd like to make it clear. This cannot happen when a vehicle is parked."" The company is still investigating why South Korea saw so many such incidents this summer. Overall, the engine failure rates in South Korea were no more numerous than in other countries where BMW has used the same software and hardware, Ebenbichler said.

172,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen replaced CEO Matthias Mueller with core brand head Herbert Diess on Thursday and said it is creating a new management structure to enable faster decision-making as autonomous and electric cars transform the industry. The German automaker said in a statement that it would reorganize its management into six broad business areas plus China. It said the new structure would streamline decision-making in the individual operating units. Diess, a former BMW executive, has had the difficult task of negotiating restructuring and cost-cutting with German worker representatives since becoming head of the Volkswagen brand in 2015. Mueller, who formerly headed Porsche, took over as CEO unexpectedly in September 2015 when Martin Winterkorn resigned over the company's scandal over cars rigged to cheat on emissions tests.  He led the Wolfsburg-based company through the aftermath of the scandal and turned in record sales and strong profits in 2017. The company sold 10.74 million vehicles and made 11.6 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in profit. Board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said Mueller, 64, had done ""outstanding work"" at a time when the company ""faced the greatest challenge in its history."" Conventional carmakers such as Volkswagen are racing with industry outsiders such as Waymo and Uber to dominate new ways of getting around, such as autonomous taxis and car-sharing services in which people use vehicles only when they need them instead of owning. Volkswagen has set up a services company, Moia, and plants to turn out more battery-powered models. The new structure will include three brand groups: volume products, premium and super premium. The company makes mass-market cars under the Volkswagen, SEAT and Skoda brands, luxury cars under the Audi nameplate and very high-priced vehicles under the Lamborghini and Bentley brands. Its statement said the truck and bus division, the fourth business group, would be made ready for capital markets, a step that could include selling shares in the division. The company did not detail the fifth and sixth business divisions ahead of a news conference scheduled for 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) Friday. Diess would not only head the management board, the top executive body at German companies that reports to the supervisory board, or board of directors. He would also have charge of vehicle development and research as well as vehicle-related information technology. Diess was the subject of speculation as a possible successor to Winterkorn when he arrived at Volkswagen from BMW less than three months before Winterkorn's sudden departure left the company needing a new CEO in a hurry. The board of directors turned to longtime company employee Mueller, who started at Audi in 1978. The company made other changes in top posts. It said the head of purchasing, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, was leaving at his own request and that his post would be filled on an acting basis by Volkswagen brand purchasing head Ralf Brandstaetter. Human resources head Karlheinz Blessing is being replaced by Gunnar Kilian, until now an official with the company's works council, or employee representatives.

245,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales shrank in December and ended 2017 up a lackluster 1.4 percent over a year earlier as the popularity of SUVs helped to offset falling demand for sedans, an industry group reported Friday. Last month's purchases of SUVs, sedans and minivans in the biggest market by number of vehicles sold shrank 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.6 million, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales including trucks and buses edged up 0.1 percent to just over 3 million. Weak demand is a setback for global automakers looking to China to drive revenue at a time when Beijing is pressing the industry to pour resources into developing electric vehicles. 2017's annual growth was barely one-tenth the previous year's 15 percent rate, which was boosted by a temporary tax cut. Chinese demand has weakened as economic growth slowed and Beijing and other major cities tightened restrictions on car ownership to curb smog and congestion. SUV sales in December rose 8.4 percent over a year earlier to just under 1.2 million, accounting for 46 percent of the total. Sedan sales shrank 4.3 percent to 1.2 million. For the year, SUV sales raced ahead 13.3 percent to 10.2 million while sedan demand shrank 2.5 percent to 11.8 million. Global auto brands including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. and local brands including Geely and BYD have grown faster than the market, taking share from smaller Chinese rivals. 2017 sales by Chinese brands rose 3 percent to 10.8 million. Their market share expanded by 0.7 percentage points over 2016 to 43.9 percent. Sales of lower-cost, Chinese-brand SUVs, the most popular vehicle segment, surged 18 percent over 2016 to 6.2 million. The industry is the midst of a massive investment campaign to ramp up production of electric vehicles under pressure from Beijing to meet official minimum sales targets that take effect in 2020. VW announced in November it will spend $11.8 billion by 2025 to develop and manufacture all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for China. Ford Motor Co. announced plans last month to roll out at least 15 new electrics in China by 2025. GM previously announced plans to start production of a pure-electric vehicle in China and launch 10 electric or gasoline-electric hybrids by 2020. General Motors said 2017 sales of GM-brand vehicles by the company and its Chinese manufacturing partners rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier to just over 4 million. VW said December sales totaled 342,100. 2017 sales were up 5.9 percent at 3.2 million. Nissan said monthly sales rose 13.4 percent to 184,297. Annual sales advanced 12.2 percent to 1.5 million. Ford's December sales slid 9 percent to 140,103. For the year, sales were down 6 percent at just under 1.2 million vehicles. Toyota's sales gained 9.4 percent to 107,500. For the year, they were up 9.4 percent at 1.3 million. Geely, known abroad as owner of Sweden's Volvo Cars, said December sales by its own brand in China rose 42 percent over a year earlier to 153,625. 2017 sales were up 63 percent at just over 1.2 million. BMW AG said December sales of BMW and Mini brand cars rose 19.2 percent to 52,026.

EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom will meet Trump in Washington to try to talk him out of imposing the auto tariffs, which would hurt the industry on both sides of the Atlantic and ratchet up trade tensions significantly. ""The aim of this visit is to cool down the situation and prevent an escalation of the trade conflict,"" Malmstrom told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in an interview. But she noted that if the U.S. proceeds with the duties, the EU is ready to respond. It will impose new tariffs on a range of U.S. products, including agricultural and high-tech products and machinery. Trump has repeatedly called the EU - which includes many of the U.S.'s oldest and most committed allies - an unfair trading partner and even labeled it a ""foe."" His administration this year imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, drawing retaliation from the EU on a series of U.S. goods. But those tariffs covered about $3 billion in goods and would pale in comparison with possible 25 percent tariffs on imports of cars, trucks and auto parts. It is unclear what Trump's approach will be in the talks. After tweeting that ""Tariffs are the greatest!"" he suggested hours later in another post that ""both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies!"" The EU's budget chief, Guenther Oettinger, said the EU was prepared to discuss lowering and restructuring all tariffs for all products. ""We want to avoid a further escalation of the trade dispute (into) a trade war,"" Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. ""We have good arguments, clear numbers and we have ideas, too."" ""Whether these will help, nobody knows. But not to try, not to fly over there for the meeting, would have been the wrong path."" Auto tariffs would be particularly painful for Germany, where the industry is huge and has long been the symbol of postwar wealth. And it is not just Europeans opposing these tariffs, but American companies as well. The duties would increase the cost of many components that American manufacturers import and use in making cars. Ultimately, that will make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers. EU has a huge stake in the U.S. industry, where European companies produce almost 3 million cars a year, accounting for over a quarter of production in the United States. The biggest exporter of U.S.-made cars is a German company — BMW, through its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. German producers and supplies employ more than 118,000 people at about 300 plants and manufacture more than 800,000 vehicles per year in the U.S. — with more than half of the cars being exported, according to figures provided by the German automotive industry. ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.",2614,2616,Auto Brand,476

272,"DETROIT (AP) — A fire that damaged a Michigan auto parts supply factory is causing production problems at Ford, Fiat Chrysler, BMW and General Motors, but it's too soon to tell yet whether dealers will run short of vehicles. So far Ford has been hit hardest by parts shortages. The company has had to temporarily lay off 7,600 workers as it cuts production of the F-Series pickup truck, the top-selling vehicle in America. But General Motors has been forced to stop producing full-size vans at a factory in Missouri, and production of Fiat Chrysler's Pacifica minivan has been curtailed in Windsor, Ontario. BMW says it expects some production interruptions at its SUV plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina. It's all because of a May 2 fire that severely damaged the main plant at the Meridian Magnesium Products of America factory in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, near Lansing that makes structural parts, about one-third of which goes to Ford. Multiple automakers have turned to Meridian to produce parts made of the lightweight metal as they try to shed pounds to meet government fuel efficiency standards. On Wednesday, Ford announced that it was suspending F-150 and Super Duty pickup production in Kansas City, Missouri; Dearborn, Michigan; and Louisville, Kentucky. The temporary layoffs took place in Kansas City and Dearborn, while workers in Louisville, Kentucky, who made the Super Duty will switch to large Lincoln and Ford SUVs that also are made at the plant. Ford says it's working with suppliers to limit the impact on production. ""We're confident that any impacts will be short-term,"" Joe Hinrichs, executive vice president and president of Global Operations, said in a statement. The company said it still has an ample selection of trucks at U.S. dealerships. At the current sales rate, Ford Motor Co. has enough trucks to last 84 days. The company said Wednesday that the parts shortage and production cuts will have a short-term impact on earnings, but Ford is sticking with full-year guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.70. While the auto industry has a history of working around parts shortages from natural disasters and fires, it may be more difficult this time because there are few companies that produce magnesium parts, said Kristen Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research's Industry, Labor & Economics Group. ""There's a lot of demand for these light-weighting materials,"" she said. ""Everybody needs it. Everybody wants it, and the supply chain isn't mature yet for this kind of volume."" Equipment that wasn't damaged will have to be relocated and automakers will have to find another place to get magnesium castings, Dziczek said. Meridian has other buildings in Eaton Rapids and another magnesium plant in Ontario, but it's unclear how much volume they can pick up, she said. A message was left Thursday for officials at Meridian. Fiat Chrysler confirmed that Pacifica production had been affected but said no workers had been laid off. Instead, they'll make more of an older minivan as the company works with Meridian to get more Pacifica parts. Spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said FCA isn't expecting any large production disruptions at any factories other than Windsor. But a union official at a Jeep Wrangler SUV plant in Toledo, Ohio, say it's possible some weekend overtime shifts could be cut due to parts shortages. Mark Epley, Jeep unit chairman for United Auto Workers Local 12, said Thursday they've got parts and still are running 10-hour shifts. ""This weekend may be a different story,"" he said. At GM's Wentzville, Missouri, factory, the company has been forced to cut production of the GMC Savana and Chevrolet Express big vans. But workers there have shifted to building midsize pickup trucks that come down the same assembly line, said spokesman Nick Richards. It's not clear how long van production will be suspended, he said. BMW said it's working to find other sources for magnesium parts but until supplies stabilize, it won't build as many X5 and X6 SUVs. X3 and X4 production won't be affected. Ford expects to continue Super Duty production at a factory in Avon Lake, Ohio, near Cleveland. The cause of the fire at the Meridian plant isn't known. Authorities said there were explosions and two workers were hurt. People reported feeling the blasts miles away. ___ John Seewer contributed to this report from Toledo, Ohio.",127,129,Auto Brand,495
293,"MUNICH (AP) — Charging an electric car away from home can be an exercise in uncertainty — hunting for that one lonely station at the back of a rest-area parking lot and hoping it's working. In Europe, some of the biggest automakers are out to remove such anxieties from the battery-only driving experience and encourage electric-vehicle sales by building a highway network of fast charging stations. The idea is to let drivers plug in, charge in minutes instead of hours, and speed off on their way — from Norway to southern Italy and Portugal to Poland. Much is at stake for the automakers, which include Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Ford. Their joint venture, Munich-based Ionity, is pushing to roll out its network in time to service the next generation of battery-only cars coming on the market starting next year. They're aiming to win back some of the market share for electric luxury car sales lost to Tesla, which has its own, proprietary fast-charging network. Despite a slower-than-expected start, Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch told The Associated Press in an interview he's ""confident"" the company will reach its goal of 400 ultra-fast charging stations averaging six charging places each by 2020. The idea is ""to be able to drive long distances with battery electric vehicles, across Europe and to have the same experience at each station, meaning a very easy and comfortable customer journey,"" Hajesch said, speaking at  the company's Munich headquarters near the 1972 Olympic stadium. The idea is to break electric cars out of the early adopter niche, in which they are charged slowly overnight at home and used for short commutes. ""The sites we are looking for are really the A-sites,"" he said, ""directly at the autobahn. Not down the road, not driving five kilometers into the next industrial area and finding a charging station somewhere, without light, or any amenities around, but right at the autobahn."" ""If you're going from Hamburg to Munich, because it's a weekend trip to friends, typically you do not have much time,"" he said. So what counts will be ""the speed of recharging your vehicles, and at the same time finding maybe some amenities: maybe a coffee, getting a newspaper or whatever."" Ionity opened its first station April 17 at a rest stop off the A61 highway near the small town of Niederzissen,  50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Bonn in western Germany. The six high-speed chargers are operating in ""welcome mode,"" meaning they're free until May 31. After that, Ionity plans to charge for the power, which it seeks to obtain from renewable sources. Ionity has agreements for some 300 sites, working with fueling station and rest stop landlords. The average distance between stations will be 120 kilometers (75 miles). More charging availability is what it will take to get an environmentally aware car buyer like Rainer Hoedt to choose a battery-only vehicle. The 58-year-old Berlin geography teacher is a proud owner of a Mitsubishi Outlander, a plug-in hybrid that combines internal combustion with a battery he can charge overnight. The battery-only range of 50 kilometers (30 miles) lets him drive emissions free for daily trips at home. But a family vacation of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the Baltic Sea was a different story. Hoedt had to drive on internal combustion before finding a lone charging station as he approached his destination, using the goingelectric.de website. ""It was right next to the highway, there was one charging station and we were lucky that it was free,"" he said. But he couldn't find a charging station he could use by the seashore. On the way back, he was able to charge at a rest stop, but only by asking a non-electric car owner to move his vehicle away from the lone charging pole. A battery-only car might never have made it home. And he couldn't use one to visit his cousin 650 kilometers (400 miles) away in Rosenheim. ""I looked at the option... The infrastructure is still so bad, I just don't want to risk that I get stranded,"" he said. ""Once the infrastructure gets better, that might be my next car."" Tesla has shown how charging infrastructure can drive vehicle sales. It has 1,229 stations with 9,623 fast chargers in Europe alone, where it has cut into Mercedes and BMW's sales of luxury cars. But it has its own proprietary plug. Ionity is using the CCS plug backed by the European Union as a common standard for all. In both the U.S. and Europe, the situation is roughly similar:  More chargers available in jurisdictions where government strongly backs electric vehicles, such as California, Norway or the Netherlands. Elsewhere, chargers get can harder to find for long stretches along rural highways. Volkswagen, which agreed to invest in low-emission driving to settle charges it cheated on diesel emissions, is building 300 highway charging sites in the U.S. by June 2019 through its Electrify America unit. Japan has 40,000 charging points, exceeding its 34,000 gas stations, according to Nissan — but many of those are private garages. Ionity is counting on the large 350-kilowatt capacity of its publicly available chargers — almost three times the 120 kilowatts per vehicle of Tesla's Superchargers. No car currently on the market can make full use of 350 kilowatt charging capacity. But they're coming: in 2019 Porsche plans to introduce the Mission E. Porsche says that the sleek, low-slung sports car will take 15 minutes to charge for 400 kilometers (250 miles) more driving. Tesla and its founder, Elon Musk, ""showed it's not enough to just build electric cars"" without also building charging infrastructure, said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the CAR Center Automotive Research at the University of Duisberg-Essen. The automakers ""are late, but it's better than it was... it remains the case that without Elon Musk the carmakers would not have realized this,"" he said.",618,620,Auto Brand,496
300,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump offers an incomplete picture of American trade in making his case for penalties on foreign goods. Here's a look at his recent comments as he prepares to impose big tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and threatens action on a broader trade front: ___ TRUMP: ""If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!"" — tweet Saturday. THE FACTS: He's wrong that automakers find it impossible to sell U.S.-made cars in Europe and that European cars come into the U.S. ""freely."" He's right about a big imbalance, but his impulse to exaggerate is on display here. The U.S. Census Bureau shows $13.8 billion in U.S. auto and parts exports last year to four countries in Europe: Germany, Britain, Belgium and France. It shows $51.3 billion in U.S. imports of autos and parts from five countries in Europe: Germany, Britain, Sweden, Italy and Austria. The EU applies a 10 percent duty on cars made in the U.S. The U.S. applies a 2.5 percent duty on cars made in Europe. In addition, Ford and Fiat Chrysler make vehicles in Europe, while Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW have factories in the U.S. — operations that could also become part of a trade war. ___ TRUMP: ""The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!"" — tweet Saturday. THE FACTS: No, the trade deficit is not $800 billion. It's $566 billion. The U.S. in 2017 bought $810 billion more in foreign goods than other countries bought from the U.S., says the Census Bureau. That deficit in goods was offset by a $244 billion trade surplus in services, like transportation, computer and financial services, royalties and military and government contracts. Similarly, Trump has complained about a trade deficit with Canada even though the U.S. runs an overall surplus with that country — thanks to the value of services. The president said in December that he corrected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on this matter when they spoke. But the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said the U.S. enjoyed a $12.5 billion trade surplus with Canada in 2016. A $12.1 billion U.S. deficit in goods was overcome by a $24.6 billion surplus in services. ___ TRUMP: ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!"" — a tweet on Friday in support of his announcement that he will impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports. THE FACTS: Trade wars have not been easy to win. The president's argument, in essence, is that high tariffs will force other countries to relent quickly on what he sees as unfair trading practices, and that will wipe out the trade gap and create factory jobs. But the record shows that tariffs, while they may help certain domestic manufacturers, can come at a broad cost. They can raise prices for consumers and businesses because companies pass on at least some of the higher costs of imports and imported materials to their customers. A trade war is also bound to mean that other countries will erect higher barriers of their own against U.S. goods and services, thereby punishing American exporters. The United States first became a net importer of steel in 1959, when steelworkers staged a 116-day strike, according to research by Michael O. Moore, a George Washington University economist. After that, U.S. administrations imposed protectionist policies, only to see global competitors adapt and the U.S. share of global steel production decline. ___ Associated Press writers Tom Krisher in Detroit and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Auto trade: https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck EDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures",1321,1323,Auto Brand,497

346,"GENEVA (AP) — Global automakers are rolling out more electric vehicles at the Geneva International Motor Show as they try to challenge Tesla and get ahead of a disruptive shift in transportation toward lower-emission and autonomous vehicles. For the European carmakers, the mood at the event could be unsettled by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat this weekend to slap tariffs on the region's manufacturers in a potential trade war. And the three big German manufacturers — Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW — will grasp the opportunity to highlight their high-tech creations amid their continued trouble with diesel technology, such as the legal attempts to ban diesel in German cities and the scandal over exposing monkeys to exhaust in lab tests. The carmakers will show off their wares during press days Monday evening through Wednesday; the show opens to the public Thursday and runs through March 18. Here are the top themes. ___ ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS The biggest trend in autos is the race to make new technologies affordable and functional. Some of the vehicles on show — such as Volkswagen's autonomous and battery-driven I.D. Vizzion — will be concepts not yet ready for production. Others will have vehicles that are ready to go on sale in coming months, such as Jaguar Land Rover with the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-driven SUV advertising 310 miles (498 kilometers) of range and rapid-charging capability. Mercedes-Benz will have an addition to its EQ electric brand. Hyundai will show its Kona Electric, with either a 300-kilometer (186-mile) or 470-kilometer (292-mile) range. Luxury carmakers like BMW and Jaguar are eager to grab back some of the sales of high-end vehicles taken by Tesla with its electric Model S high-performance sedan and Model X SUV. When it comes to technological change there will be more than vehicles to talk about. The German automakers and Ford are working to build a network of fast-charging stations across Europe through their joint venture, Ionity. The idea is to make electric vehicles more appealing by enabling longer trips. Currently, many electric models are charged over several hours at home at night and used for short commutes, limiting their use. Ionity's 350 kilowatt-per-hour charging capacity could cut charge times to 15 minutes or less. Automakers are under pressure to come up with vehicles propelled by something other than internal combustion engines to comply with government efforts to reduce air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for global warming. The issue became even more pressing after a German court said last week that polluted cities can ban older-model diesels. Diesel sales had already slipped after Volkswagen's 2015 scandal over cheating on emissions tests. Autonomous vehicles could herald a shift to transportation as a service with less incentive to own a car. Analysts at IHS Markit estimate that autonomous cars will have their first significant sales volume with 51,000 units in 2021 and surpass 33 million per year by 2040. ___ MONKEY BUSINESS All three German auto makers have condemned the 2014 experiment in which Volkswagen had macaque monkeys exposed to diesel exhaust at a lab in New Mexico. The tests were commissioned through a now-disbanded organization whose board had representatives from BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler. They have said they're investigating how the tests happened. The show won't erase public indignation or media questions but at least offers a chance to talk about something other than a PR disaster. ___ SEEN THAT ALREADY Some of the more important vehicles at the show have already been revealed as companies use stand-alone events to show off their new cars rather than putting them on display in a crowd of other vehicles. That's the case with Mercedes-Benz A-Class, its small entry model hatchback that was unveiled Feb. 2 in Amsterdam. The car features voice-activated control of navigation, phone, music and heating and air conditioning somewhat like Amazon and Google's devices for home use. The Jaguar I-Pace had a digital unveiling from Graz, Austria on Thursday ahead of the show — showing it beating two Tesla models in a race. ___ IF YOU HAVE TO ASK HOW MUCH Geneva is typically a place to show off gorgeous, extremely fast and very, very expensive vehicles. A taste: Luxury sports car maker McLaren offers the low-slung Senna, named after the race driver Ayrton Senna. Its 800 horsepower turbocharged V8 engine takes it to a top speed of 340 kph (211 mph).  Just 500 of the sleek, carbon-fiber vehicles will be built, hand-assembled at the company's production center in Woking, Surrey, England. The price:  750,000 pounds including tax, which translates to $1.03 million at today's exchange rate. Want one? Sorry. The company says it has buyers for all of them.",501,503,Auto Brand,500
352,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — European businesses are unsettled as they watch the U.S. and China collide over trade. And for good reason: the nascent global trade war could represent the biggest single threat to the economic upswing that has helped the region get past its financial crisis. In theory, some European companies could benefit, jumping into market niches if Chinese businesses are kept out of the U.S. market. But that would only be a few companies or sectors. When your entire economy is heavily dependent on trade, an overall slowdown in global commerce caused by tit-for-tat import taxes provokes fear and undermines confidence. And that's just what's happening in Europe. By one measure, business confidence has fallen in six of the past seven months in Germany, where exports are almost half of annual economic output. ""It's worth all our efforts to defuse this conflict, so it doesn't become a war,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday. The U.S. is due to put tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday. The Chinese will respond with tariffs on an equivalent value of U.S. products such as soybeans, seafood and crude oil. Amid all this, Europe has its own trade dispute with the U.S. After the U.S. put tariffs on steel and aluminum from many allies, including the European Union, the 28-country bloc responded with import taxes on some $3.25 billion of U.S. goods. The Trump administration is also studying the option of putting tariffs on cars, which would significantly escalate the confrontation. The head of the EU's executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, will head to Washington in late July to try to personally persuade Trump against further measures targeting Europe. The disputes over trade threaten to spoil the good times for Europe's economy. Growth last year was the strongest in a decade, since before the global financial crisis. While that has eased in recent quarters, the economy is still strong enough to create jobs. The number of unemployed fell by 125,000 in May, leaving unemployment in the 19 countries that use the euro at 8.4 percent, the lowest since 2008 and down from a high of 12.1 percent in 2013. ""Trade tensions stoked by U.S. President Donald Trump are clouding the economic outlook in Europe,"" wrote analysts at Berenberg bank in London. They rated the trade risk ahead of troubles from Italy's heavy debt load or faster than expected interest rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Many European companies would suffer because they both produce and sell goods in the U.S. and China, the world's biggest economies. For example, tariffs that China is expected to impose Friday on U.S.-made autos would hit German carmakers Daimler and BMW since they both make vehicles in the United States and export them to China. Daimler has already lowered its outlook for profits, citing higher than expected costs from the new tariffs. BMW warned in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday that tariffs would make it harder for it to sell in China the vehicles it builds at its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, ""potentially leading to a strongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States."" Last year, BMW exported 272,000 vehicles from the Spartanburg plant, more than half its total production. Of those, 81,000 — worth $2.37 billion — went to China. BMW says its exports reduced the U.S. trade deficit by around $1 billion. By themselves, the tariffs that take effect Friday won't immediately have a dramatic impact on global trade. The fear is that retaliation will spiral, hitting the total amount of global commerce. Even if the overall effect is to harm growth, there could be benefits for some European companies and sectors. Economists Alicia Garcia Herrero and Jianwei Xu at the French bank Natixis say that European makers of cars, aircraft, chemicals, computer chips and factory machinery could in theory snare market share by substituting for Chinese or American products in the two markets. But that's only if Europe's own trade dispute with the U.S. does not escalate — a big if. Europe is waiting to see whether the Trump administration will go ahead separately with tariffs on auto imports. European companies like BMW, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen's Porsche and Audi divisions, and Fiat Chrysler send $46.6 billion worth of vehicles every year to the U.S. Some 13.3 million people, or 6.1 percent of the employed population of the EU, work in the automotive sector, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. ""Europe cannot win anything"" on an overall basis ""for one obvious reason: we are net exporters,"" said Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis and a senior fellow at European research institute Bruegel. ""But we should not understate the view that some sectors could get something out of a U.S.-China trade war."" Amid the brewing conflict, China has sought to get Europe on its side, putting on a diplomatic charm offensive during visits by Merkel and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The EU and China agreed last month to deepen commercial ties and support trade rules. But the EU remains a close, longtime ally of the U.S. on a range of issues, despite the current tensions with the Trump administration. One negative outcome for Europe, Herrero said, would be if Trump can push the Chinese into a trade agreement aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The additional U.S. goods to China could come at the expense of European competitors. ""If China concedes to the U.S. proposed agreement, the whole situation faced by the EU would be much tougher,"" she and Xu wrote in a research note. ""For China to massively reduce its trade surplus with the U.S., it has to in some way substitute its imports away from the EU to the U.S., which would have a significant negative impact on the EU producers."" ___ Complete coverage:",2710,2712,Auto Brand,501

361,"DETROIT (AP) — Cars and trucks with electronic driver assist systems may not see stopped vehicles and could even steer you into a crash if you're not paying attention, an insurance industry group warns. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, in a paper titled ""Reality Check,"" issued the warning Tuesday after testing five of the systems from Tesla, Mercedes, BMW and Volvo on a track and public roads. The upshot is while they could save your life, the systems can fail under many circumstances. ""We have found situations where the vehicles under semi-automated control may do things that can put you and your passengers at risk, and so you really need to be on top of it to prevent that from happening,"" said David Zuby, the institute's chief research officer. Among the scariest found by the Virginia-based institute was with the system in two Tesla vehicles, the Model S and Model 3. The institute tested the system with the adaptive cruise control turned off, but automatic braking on. At 31 miles per hour, both Teslas braked and mitigated a crash but still hit a stationary balloon. They were the only two models that failed to stop in time during tests on a track. Yet when the adaptive cruise control, which keeps a set distance from cars in front, is activated, the Teslas braked earlier and gentler and avoided the balloon, the agency said. On the road, the institute's engineers found that all the vehicles but Tesla's Model 3 failed to respond to stopped vehicles ahead of them, the institute said. The systems tested, in the Teslas, BMW's 5-Series, the Volvo S-90 and the Mercedes E-Class, are among the best in the business right now and have been rated ""superior"" in previous IIHS tests. Zuby said the systems do increase safety but the tests show they are not 100 percent reliable. Many of the scenarios discovered by IIHS are covered in the vehicles' owner's manuals, which tell drivers they have to pay attention. But Zuby said not many people read their owner's manuals in detail. Even though the systems have names like Tesla's ""Autopilot"" or Volvo's ""Pilot Assist,"" they are not self-driving vehicles, Zuby said. ""They will help you with some steering or speed control but you really better be paying attention because they don't always get it right,"" he said. Many of the cars' lane-centering systems failed, especially on curves or hills. The BMW, Model S and Volvo ""steered toward or across the lane line regularly,"" requiring driver intervention, the IIHS said. The IIHS-affiliated Highway Loss Data Institute analyzed Tesla insurance losses to find that automatic braking and other crash avoidance features on the Model S were helpful in reducing property damage and bodily injury claims.  But adding ""Autopilot,"" which includes automatic steering and lane-changing, only helped to lower collision claims. The institute, which in the past has developed tests that made the auto industry strengthen vehicle structures, also said the California crash of a Tesla Model X SUV in March that killed a man shows the limits of the technology and the tendency of some drivers to misuse it. The group also said a pedestrian death in Arizona involving an Uber autonomous vehicle shows the dangers of testing self-driving vehicles on public roads. IIHS is developing ratings for driver assist systems and eventually will make recommendations on regulations for fully autonomous vehicles, Zuby said. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the automakers.",365,367,Auto Brand,503

388,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's business community is calling on the state's congressional delegation to help educate the Trump administration about effects its trade policies could have on the state's economy. In a letter sent Tuesday to South Carolina's two U.S. senators and seven House members, South Carolina Chamber of Commerce President Ted Pitts asked the state's delegation ""to do whatever it takes to inform the administration about the jobs at risk when it takes a narrower view of trade."" Last Friday, the United States slapped 25 percent taxes on $34 billion in Chinese imports, mostly industrial goods the Trump administration says receive subsidies or other unfair support from Beijing. China quickly lashed back with tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. products. Some manufacturers in South Carolina have expressed concerns about the effects of the administration's shifting trade policy. BMW, which employs 10,000 people in its South Carolina plant, said on Monday that it would raise prices on U.S.-built SUVs exported to China due to the tariffs. According to the dpa news agency, the Munich-based company said that it is ""not in a position to completely absorb the tariff increases."" Last month, BMW warned in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that tariffs would make it harder for it to sell its South Carolina-made vehicles in China, ""potentially leading to a strongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States."" Through the Charleston port, the BMW vehicles produced in South Carolina are exported to 140 countries, making BMW the largest U.S. auto exporter. Last year, BMW exported 272,000 vehicles from the Spartanburg plant, more than half its total production. Of those, 81,000 — worth $2.37 billion — went to China. BMW says its exports reduced the U.S. trade deficit by around $1 billion. In his letter, Pitts beseeched U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, along with the state's seven U.S. House members, to impress upon the administration that its actions could have negative repercussions in states like South Carolina, which strongly backed President Donald Trump's candidacy. ""The administration's approach to tariffs and trade needs to be broader in thought and more targeted in its application,"" Pitts wrote. ""Otherwise, it will cost South Carolina jobs as manufacturers do what any business would do: shift production to other facilities around the world where it costs less to do business."" Gov. Henry McMaster, an early Trump campaign supporter, is backed by the president in his own campaign this year and has been largely silent on the tariff issue. Earlier this week, the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg - in whose distribution area the BMW plant is located - penned an calling on the governor ""to intercede on behalf of South Carolinians who could lose their jobs because of the president's policies."" ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

434,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen is seeking to reassure German customers that they can trade in their new diesel auto if the car is banned from the road by cities trying to meeting air pollution limits. The company said Thursday that the guarantee applies to new cars bought from a Volkswagen dealer from April 1 through the end of the year, and would be good for three years. The German courts have ruled that cities with high pollution levels can impose diesel driving bans. That follows Volkswagen's 2015 scandal over diesels rigged to cheat on emissions tests. Diesel sales have fallen. Volkswagen along with BMW and Daimler say that the newest diesels meet tightened emissions standards and emit less carbon dioxide, making them essential to meeting European Union limits on greenhouse gases.",617,619,Auto Brand,511
440,"BERLIN (AP) — Handing environmentalists a landmark victory, a German court ruled Tuesday that cities can ban diesel cars and trucks to combat air pollution, a decision with far-reaching and costly implications in the country where the diesel engine was invented in the 1890s. The ruling by the Federal Administrative Court stirred fears from motorists, auto dealers and other businesses worried about the financial impact. And Chancellor Angela Merkel's government scrambled to reassure drivers it would seek to prevent such drastic measures by pushing other ways to reduce urban pollution. Diesel automobiles are a popular alternative to gasoline-powered ones in Germany, with about 9 million diesel cars and several million trucks, buses and other vehicles affected by the ruling. Overall, 1 in 3 passenger cars in Germany, home to such automakers as Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW, are diesel-powered, though the cleanest, most modern models would probably still be allowed even if cities decided on a ban. ""It's a great day for clean air in Germany,"" said Juergen Resch, head of the group Environmental Action Germany, which had sued dozens of German cities for failing to meet legally binding emissions limits. While diesel cars produce less carbon dioxide and tend to get better mileage than gas-powered vehicles, they emit higher levels of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, contributing to respiratory illnesses and 6,000 deaths annually, according to government figures. Two German states had appealed lower court decisions that suggested bans on particularly dirty diesel cars would be effective. Germany's highest administrative court rejected that appeal Tuesday, effectively instructing two cities at the center of the case — Stuttgart and Duesseldorf — to consider bans as part of their clean air plans. What comes next is an open question. It's not clear whether cities will actually move to ban diesels. And if they do so, it remains to be seen whether automakers will be forced to upgrade exhaust and software systems or buy back vehicles; if the government will offer consumers incentives; or if owners will be left on their own, forced to bear the costs. The Leipzig-based administrative court said cities won't be required to compensate drivers for being unable to use their diesel cars. Speaking on behalf of automakers, Matthias Wissmann, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, stressed that the government could ease the uncertainty by not leaving it to cities to decide on a case-by-case basis. ""We hope it comes to sensible national regulations,"" he said. European cities considering diesel bans like Copenhagen and Paris will be watching how the situation plays out in Germany as they make their own decisions. Jeff Schuster, an analyst with the consulting firm LMC Automotive near Detroit, said diesel bans could spread to other polluted European cities. But he said the market in Europe, China and elsewhere was already headed in that direction because of the big push toward electric vehicles and the damage done by the Volkswagen diesel-emissions cheating scandal. Diesels make up a smaller part of the American auto market, and so any bans in Europe would have little effect on the U.S., Schuster said. For the past two years in the U.S., only 2.7 percent of registered vehicles were diesel, according to Kelley Blue Book. New diesel car sales in Germany were already declining in anticipation of the decision, and also because of the VW scandal. Used-car dealers fretted about what the ruling will mean for the vehicles on their lots. ""The prices as well as the demand are going down rapidly,"" said Marcel del Arbol, owner of R&M used car dealership in Frankfurt. ""What happened today will bring the prices down even more. German car companies dipped on the stock market following the ruling but mostly recovered, with Volkswagen down 0.9 percent at the end of the day, BMW down 0.06 percent and Daimler up 0.2 percent. Analysts said the ruling might actually prove to be a boon for the economy if drivers choose to upgrade their engines or buy new models. Merkel sought to downplay the prospect of widespread diesel driving bans, suggesting that many of the 70 German cities that regularly exceed pollution limits might be able to cut harmful emissions with other measures such as software upgrades in vehicles and converting bus and taxi fleets to electric power. Experts, however, questioned whether bans can be avoided and accused the German government of ignoring the health problems caused by diesel for too long. Fritz Kuhn, the Green Party mayor of Stuttgart, home to automakers Daimler and Porsche, accused the government of leaving it to cities to clean up the mess by failing to provide a nationwide solution. Political leaders stressed that diesel owners shouldn't have to shoulder the full burden of a ban. ""The auto industry that caused the harmful emissions has to upgrade diesel engines at its expense,"" said Kai Wegner, a lawmaker who speaks for Merkel's party on urban issues. The ruling alarmed groups representing small and medium-size companies. Diesels — first developed by Rudolf Diesel in Augsburg over a century ago — are a mainstay of many company fleets and are widely used by taxi companies and delivery services. Berlin's Chamber of Commerce said companies in the capital would have to spend 240 million euros ($295 million) to replace their fleets if diesel cars were banned — enough to drive many out of business. ___ Associated Press writers Kerstin Sopke in Leipzig, Christoph Noelting in Frankfurt and Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report.",877,879,Auto Brand,512

521,"DETROIT (AP) — It's the year of the pickup truck at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford unveil new trucks in a fast-growing and highly competitive U.S. auto market. But there are plenty of other vehicles at the show, which is one of the industry's largest. Mercedes and BMW have new SUVs, while several Japanese automakers are showing off prototypes of future vehicles. It's all happening in a U.S. auto market that's shrinking but still expected to remain at healthy levels. Last year sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million, still near record highs. Analysts expect sales to be just under 17 million in 2018. Here are some of the vehicles being unveiled at the show, which opens to the general public on Saturday: ACURA RDX PROTOTYPE Honda Motor Co.'s struggling Acura luxury brand hopes to revive sales with a new version of its best-selling RDX. Acura showed a prototype of the midsize SUV at the show, but it's close to the version that will go on sale in mid-2018. The 2019 RDX, which is the first to be designed in the U.S., is longer, lower and wider than the current model, with sharper lines outlined in chrome. A wide, panoramic glass roof will come standard. Under the hood is a new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Acura says the RDX will have the most legroom and cargo space in its class. There's also a touchpad to control infotainment functions on the 10.2-inch dashboard screen. Acura didn't reveal pricing, fuel economy or other details. VOLKSWAGEN JETTA Volkswagen's redesigned Jetta offers more room — and a shot at redemption as the automaker recovers from a 2015 emissions-cheating scandal. The German automaker says the 2019 Jetta is longer, wider and taller than previous models. VW also aims for a sportier look, with a large front grille, higher chrome quotient and LED lighting. The car has a new standard six-speed manual transmission. An eight-speed automatic transmission is optional on the base model. The Jetta's revamped interior includes a new storage console large enough to fit a standard iPad. The car is among the first of two new models planned this year and will come with a six-year, 72,000-mile warranty — double what it has been. It goes on sale in the second quarter at a starting price of $18,545 — less than its predecessor. FORD EDGE Ford Motor Co. is introducing a high-performance version of its midsize Edge SUV this summer: the Edge ST. It has a 2.7-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 engine that puts out 335 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. That's paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive comes standard, and there's a specially tuned sport suspension. The Edge ST also has special design cues, including a wide mesh grille, 21-inch wheels and ""performance blue"" paint. The regular Edge also gets an update, with a more efficient 2.0-liter four-cylinder that puts out 250 horsepower. New safety features include ""evasive steering assist,"" which uses cameras and radar to detect slower-moving vehicles. Pricing on the Edge and Edge ST hasn't yet been released. TOYOTA AVALON Toyota has taken the wraps off its revamped Avalon, which features a longer, lower and wider exterior and a rear cabin that extends another 7 inches (17.8 centimeters). The automaker boasts of a ""neater"" steering wheel, with a smaller switch cluster, enlarged hand grips and cruise control now accessible on the right spoke. The touch screen can be ""pinched"" or ""flicked"" like a smartphone. The new Avalon also can connect with a smart watch or Amazon Alexa-enabled device. The car has two new powertrains: a 3.5-liter V6 and 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid system. The Michigan-designed Avalon will arrive in showrooms in late spring. FORD MUSTANG BULLITT Ford Motor Co. is making a special edition Mustang to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ""Bullitt,"" whose unforgettable car chase scene helped turn the sports car into an icon. The 2019 Mustang Bullitt — due out this summer — will have an upgraded 5.0-liter V8 engine that puts out 475 horsepower. It has a top speed of 163 miles per hour (262 kilometers per hour) and a manual transmission with a white cue-ball shift knob. It's available in dark highland green, the color ""Bullitt"" made famous, as well as black. Molly McQueen — granddaughter of ""Bullitt"" star Steve McQueen — introduced the 2019 Mustang Bullitt on Sunday at the Detroit auto show. It's the first Ford has produced since 2008. Ford didn't reveal the cost. MERCEDES G-CLASS Mercedes' boxy-looking G-Class SUV gets a face-lift that the company says will boost performance both on and off the road. The company readily acknowledges that its appearance hasn't changed much in almost four decades. But the 2019 version gets numerous changes including 2 additional inches (5 additional centimeters) of length and 4.8 inches (12 centimeters) of width. The G-Class gets a new independent front suspension as well as a nine-speed automatic transmission. It's still powered by a 4-liter V8 with 416 horsepower. It also gets new LED headlamps. The G-Class will go on sale in the U.S. by late 2018, but no specific date was announced, nor pricing or fuel mileage. BMW X2 BMW's sporty X2 small SUV will sit between the compact X1 and the bigger X3 in the automaker's lineup. It sits low and has a more muscular body than its siblings. The X2 also has a widened version of BMW's signature double kidney grille. The 228-horsepower xDrive28i, which goes on sale in the U.S. in March, is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It's mated to an eight-speed transmission. The 192-horsepower sDrive28i goes on sale later this spring. Drivers can flip a switch and choose a driving mode, from comfort, eco-friendly or sport. The suspension can also be lowered for more dynamic driving. On the optional M Sport X Package, drivers get gearshift paddles on the steering wheel for quicker shifting.

616,"LONDON (AP) — Britain passed a Brexit hurdle as its flagship European Union Withdrawal Bill became law Tuesday. But the government faced a new warning from business that uncertainty about the U.K.'s departure from the EU was putting investment and jobs at risk. Pro-Brexit lawmakers in the House of Commons cheered as Speaker John Bercow announced that the European Union Withdrawal Bill had received royal assent. The bill was passed by Parliament last week and officially became law with the granting of assent by Queen Elizabeth II — a technicality, since no monarch has refused to sign a bill since 1707. Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""a historic moment for our country and a significant step towards delivering on the will of the British people."" The bill, which will translate thousands of pieces of EU law into British statute, faced a rocky journey through Parliament. Pro-EU lawmakers and members of the House of Lords tried to amend it to soften the terms of Britain's departure. Most of the changes were overturned by narrow Commons votes. But pro-EU lawmakers say they will try to defeat the government on other EU-related legislation if it tries to push for a ""hard Brexit"" that severs close economic ties between Britain and the bloc. With nine months to go until Britain leaves the EU on March 29, 2019, businesses say uncertainty about the divorce terms is starting to hurt the economy. On Tuesday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said investment in auto production fell by almost half in the last year. It was 347 million pounds ($460 million) in the first half of 2018, down from 647 million pounds during the same period a year earlier. Chief Executive Mike Hawes said the British government's insistence that the U.K. will leave the EU's tariff-free single market and customs union ""goes directly against the interests of the U.K. automotive sector, which has thrived on single market and customs union membership."" ""Our message to government is that until it can demonstrate exactly how a new model for customs and trade with the EU can replicate the benefits we currently enjoy, don't change it,"" he said. The industry statement follows warnings from manufacturers Airbus, Siemens and BMW that leaving the EU without a comprehensive free trade deal would hurt British businesses and cost thousands of jobs. Uncertainty is already having an impact. A survey by law firm Baker McKenzie has found that almost half of EU businesses have cut back on their investment in Britain since the 2016 vote to leave the bloc. The survey found that European businesses widely support a post-Brexit deal that keeps trade relations as close as possible to the existing conditions Many U.K.-based businesses want the same thing, but the British government is split between Brexit-backing ministers who want a clean break so that Britain can strike new trade deals around the world, and those who want to keep closely aligned to the bloc, Britain's biggest trading partner. May is caught between the two factions. She says Britain will leave the EU single market and customs union while seeking ""as frictionless as possible"" trade with the bloc.

619,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales shrank in July from a year earlier as SUV demand sagged, an industry group reported Friday, adding to signs of economic malaise amid a tariff battle with Washington. Sales of sedans, SUVs and minivans fell 5.3 percent from a year ago to 1.6 million in the biggest global auto market, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, fell 4 percent to 1.9 million. Auto demand has cooled amid forecasts of an economic downturn after Beijing tightened controls on bank lending to cool surging debt. China's mounting tariff fight with U.S. President Donald Trump over Chinese technology policy has added to anxiety, though the economic impact so far is limited. Beijing imposed 25 percent import duties on U.S.-made autos as part of its retaliation for a similar American increase. But that falls most heavily on BMW AG's imports of SUVs from a South Carolina factory. American brands produce most of their vehicles in Chinese factories. Weak demand is a setback for global automakers that look to China to drive revenue and are spending heavily to develop models for local tastes. Sales growth in June decelerated to 2.3 percent from the previous month's 7.9 percent. Full-year 2017 sales growth was 1.4 percent. SUV sales, usually the industry's bright spot, contracted 8.4 percent from a year earlier to 633,000, according to CAAM. Sedan sales shrank 1.2 percent to 815,000. Sales of pure electric and gasoline-electric hybrids, boosted by subsidies and other government support, rose 47.7 percent to 84,000 but made up just 5 percent of the total. Beijing is in the midst of a multibillion-dollar campaign to promote electric car development and sales in hopes of creating a profitable new industry.

622,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Public criticism of the German auto industry has escalated after a report that an industry-sponsored entity commissioned a study of the effects of diesel exhaust using monkeys, while another study exposed humans to low levels of one type of air pollutant. The German government on Monday condemned the experiments and Volkswagen sought to distance itself from them, with its chairman saying that ""in the name of the whole board I emphatically disavow such practices."" The tests were reportedly commissioned by a research group funded by major German auto companies. Revelations of the tests add a twist to the German auto industry's attempt to move past Volkswagen's scandal over cheating on diesel tests and the resulting questioning of diesel technology across the industry. Volkswagen Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said the tests must be ""investigated completely and without reservation,"" the dpa news agency reported. A report by The New York Times found that the research group financed by top German car manufacturers commissioned experiments in which one group of monkeys was exposed to diesel exhaust from a late-model Volkswagen, while another group was exposed to fumes from an older Ford pickup. The experiments were carried out in 2014 before Volkswagen was caught using software that let vehicles cheat on emissions tests. They were intended to show modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions, but according to the Times report the Volkswagen car in the tests was equipped with illegal software that turned emissions controls on while the car was on test stands and off during regular driving. Volkswagen admitted using the software in 2015. The Volkswagen scandal led to public scrutiny of diesel emissions as regulators discovered that other companies' vehicles also had higher emissions on the road than during testing, though not necessarily through illegal rigging. The industry has had to fend off calls for diesel bans in German cities with high pollution levels. Daimler AG said it was ""appalled by the nature and extent of the studies"" and said that, though it didn't have any influence on the studies' design, ""we have launched a comprehensive investigation into the matter."" BMW said that it ""did not participate in the mentioned study"" on animals ""and distances itself from this study."" It said it was investigating the work and background of the research group. The Times report said the group that commissioned the studies, known by German initial EUGT, got all of its funding from the three automakers. The Times report was followed by one in Monday's edition of the Stuttgarter Zeitung daily that the now-closed research group also commissioned tests in which humans were exposed to nitrogen dioxide, which belongs to a class of pollutants known as nitrogen oxides. The group reportedly said the tests showed no effect on the subjects. The human study, carried out by Aachen University, involved studying the effects of exposing 25 subjects, mostly students, to low levels of nitrogen dioxide like those that could be found in the environment — from a 40-liter bottle, not a diesel engine. The individuals gave informed written consent for the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the university's medical faculty, according to the study. The university said the study had no relation to the diesel scandal. The German government condemned the reported tests on animals and humans. Transport Minister Christian Schmidt ""has no understanding for such tests ... that do not serve science but merely PR aims,"" spokesman Ingo Strater told reporters in Berlin. He called for the companies concerned to provide ""immediate and detailed"" responses, and said a ministry commission of inquiry that was set up after the emissions scandal broke will hold a special meeting to examine whether there are any other cases. Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that ""the disgust many people are feeling is absolutely understandable."" ""These tests on monkeys or even humans can in no way be ethically justified,"" Seibert said. ""They raise many critical questions for those behind these tests, and these questions must urgently be answered."" He questioned the aims of the tests. ""The automakers have to reduce emissions of harmful substances further and further,"" he said. ""They should not be trying to prove the supposed harmlessness of exhaust with the help of monkeys or even humans."" Seibert said that the supervisory boards of the companies concerned ""have a particular responsibility."" The governor of the German state of Lower Saxony, a major shareholder in Volkswagen, added his voice to calls for quick answers. Stephan Weil, who sits on VW's supervisory board, stressed that ""the behavior of the company must in every respect fulfill ethical demands."" He said he hadn't known about the tests. ___ This story has been corrected to show that a research group commissioned the tests, not that it carried them out. A previous version corrected the first paragraph to show that the second set of tests on humans didn't involve diesel exhaust.",2249,2251,Auto Brand,524

652,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Automaker Volkswagen has suspended a top executive in response to widespread public criticism over experiments in which monkeys were exposed to diesel exhaust. The company said in a statement Tuesday that Thomas Steg, head of government relations and sustainability, was stepping away from his duties at his own request. The statement said the company was ""drawing the first consequences"" as it investigates the activities of EUGT, the entity backed by Volkswagen and other carmakers that commissioned the monkey experiment. Steg had said in an interview published in the newspaper Bild that he had known about the experiment but did not inform the company's then-CEO, Martin Winterkorn. Steg said he rejected an initial proposal to use human volunteers and said that even after animals were substituted the experiment ""should not have taken place."" The move follows a report in The New York Times that the now-disbanded EUGT commissioned the 2014 monkey test at the Lovelace Respiratory Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to measure how Volkswagen's diesel technology was succeeding in controlling harmful emissions. Diluted exhaust gases from a late-model Volkswagen vehicle were fed into chambers where the monkeys were exposed for four hours. Afterward, lung fluid samples were taken from the sedated monkeys, which were not killed for the experiment.  The study did not deliver a definitive result. The test was done with a vehicle that used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests, turning controls off when the vehicle was not being tested. That practice was exposed in 2015, leading to Winterkorn's resignation. The Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute said in a statement that the tests were designed by EUGT and the lab itself was initially not aware the vehicle had been rigged.  It said it complied with regulations for the treatment of lab animals and was committed to their humane and ethical treatment. The labs president and CEO, Robert W. Rubin, said in a statement that when the lab later learned that the vehicle engine had been modified to produce less pollution ""we determined the study was compromised"" and did not meet the standards for publication. ""We understood that the EUGT organization was financially supported by automobile manufacturers, but we believed the goal of the study was to advance the scientific understanding of the effects of diesel fumes on our lungs, including the effects of new vehicle technologies that are designed to produce less pollution,"" he said. Volkswagen's current CEO, Matthias Mueller, said in the VW statement that ""we are investigating in detail the work of EUGT, which was dissolved in 2017, and drawing the necessary conclusions."" He said Steg ""has declared that he takes full responsibility, and I respect that."" Volkswagen said the probe would be carried out ""at top speed."" Board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said the board's executive committee expected to hear the status of the investigation next week, the dpa news agency reported. ""We will ensure that such things will not be repeated,"" he said. The company has said that rejects animal experiments and that ""we apologize for the wrong behavior and bad decisions of individuals."" Government officials, environmental groups and animal rights activists all condemned the experiment. Daimler and BMW also condemned the experiment and said they were investigating. The New York Times report said the three companies backed EUGT financially. The monkey scandal is another black eye for the German auto industry as it seeks to move past the Volkswagen scandal and the doubts it unleashed over how clean diesel technology really was. Volkswagen paid billions in fines and settlements and pleaded guilty to criminal charges. The Volkswagen case led to increased scrutiny of diesel cars from other manufacturers, which were found to emit more in everyday driving than during tests, though not necessarily through illegal software as at Volkswagen.",3352,3354,Auto Brand,527
666,"HELSINKI (AP) — Top European Union officials were going into a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday warning they are ready to put tariffs on $20 billion of American goods if he puts duties on car imports. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom will meet Trump in Washington to try to talk him out of imposing the auto tariffs, which would hurt the industry on both sides of the Atlantic and ratchet up trade tensions significantly. ""The aim of this visit is to cool down the situation and prevent an escalation of the trade conflict,"" Malmstrom told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in an interview. But she noted that if the U.S. proceeds with the duties, the EU is ready to respond. It will impose new tariffs on a range of U.S. products, including agricultural and high-tech products and machinery. Trump has repeatedly called the EU - which includes many of the U.S.'s oldest and most committed allies - an unfair trading partner and even labeled it a ""foe."" His administration this year imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, drawing retaliation from the EU on a series of U.S. goods. But those tariffs covered about $3 billion in goods and would pale in comparison with possible 25 percent tariffs on imports of cars, trucks and auto parts. It is unclear what Trump's approach will be in the talks. After tweeting that ""Tariffs are the greatest!"" he suggested hours later in another post that ""both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies!"" The EU's budget chief, Guenther Oettinger, said the EU was prepared to discuss lowering and restructuring all tariffs for all products. ""We want to avoid a further escalation of the trade dispute (into) a trade war,"" Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. ""We have good arguments, clear numbers and we have ideas, too."" ""Whether these will help, nobody knows. But not to try, not to fly over there for the meeting, would have been the wrong path."" Auto tariffs would be particularly painful for Germany, where the industry is huge and has long been the symbol of postwar wealth. And it is not just Europeans opposing these tariffs, but American companies as well. The duties would increase the cost of many components that American manufacturers import and use in making cars. Ultimately, that will make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers. EU has a huge stake in the U.S. industry, where European companies produce almost 3 million cars a year, accounting for over a quarter of production in the United States. The biggest exporter of U.S.-made cars is a German company — BMW, through its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. German producers and supplies employ more than 118,000 people at about 300 plants and manufacture more than 800,000 vehicles per year in the U.S. — with more than half of the cars being exported, according to figures provided by the German automotive industry. ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.",2614,2616,Auto Brand,476

689,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of a Senate panel voiced frustration Tuesday with the pace of repairs for vehicles with defective Takata air bag inflators and urged regulators to complete work on a federal rule that would require automakers to use email and other forms of electronic communication when notifying car owners about recall campaigns. Takata air bag inflators can explode with too much force and spew shrapnel into drivers and passengers. At least 22 people have died worldwide and more than 180 have been hurt. A yearslong recall involves about 50 million Takata air bag inflators in the United States. To date, about 21 million defective air bags have been repaired. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee recently asked the 19 automakers involved in the Takata recall to provide the repair rates for their vehicles. Nelson said the completion rates for the most widely affected companies ranged from Honda Motor Co., 70 percent; Toyota Motor Corp, 61 percent; Fiat Chrysler, 41 percent; and Ford Motor Co, 22 percent. He said BMW failed to provide the committee with its most recent figures. ""Overall, these recall completion rates are disappointing, unacceptable and remain a cause for great concern,"" Nelson said. Heidi King of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acknowledged that repair rates are ""not where we want them to be."" She said the agency is exploring new ways to reach consumers and improve response rates to recall notifications. But King could not tell lawmakers when the agency would finish writing the rule that would require automakers to use electronic communications in its recall notices as well as traditional mail. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., asked if the rule would be issued this year. King would only say it's ""in progress."" ""Send a clear signal to the industry as to what is required,"" Markey said. ""The longer this goes, the more endangered the public is."" The federal government has described the Takata recall as the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. history. King said automakers have made progress in persuading customers to bring in their vehicles, but called that progress ""uneven.""",1086,1088,Auto Brand,529
727,"Depreciation may be the bane of new-car buyers, but it's also the reason so many shoppers buy used. We scoured our annual Edmunds New Car Buying Guides from years past to see what cars we loved back in the day can now be had for $15,000 or less. For each vehicle, we've provided a range of years offering the best selection and value. In certain cases, getting an even older model is a viable option, too. SMALL CARS The is a great place to begin our list. We didn't like this generation Civic much when it came out for 2011, but Honda improved it dramatically by 2013. It's spacious and easy to live with, and it offers quite a few technology options. It's also available as a fuel-sipping hybrid or as the fun-to-drive 205-horsepower Civic Si. For more luxurious comfort and safety, check out the and the . This Volvo has front seats perfect for long hauls, and the available engines are surprisingly peppy. If you value performance over practicality, try the . It never sold in big numbers, but this littlest BMW provides lots of fun in either coupe or convertible guise. Finally, the combines fun with hatchback practicality. The GTI has always been one of our favorites thanks to its refined driving experience and near-luxury interior. MIDSIZE CARS The marked a turning point for Cadillac, challenging European competitors with its quality, comfort and driving precision. Look for CTS models with the 3.6-liter direct-injected V6, which puts out 304 horsepower without sacrificing fuel economy. The is a good all-arounder that didn't stand out from the crowd when new. But for under $15,000, it makes a compelling alternative to a used Accord. Look for one with the Ttechnology package to get the rearview camera and upgraded sound and navigation systems. For something a little newer, try the . Like many Mazdas, a used Mazda 6 can be a little hard to find, but its handling is among the best in the class. An upscale interior, plenty of backseat room, and an easy-to-use technology interface round out the appeal of this late-model midsize car. SUVs The safe bet for used SUVs is the . It's a practical, reliable compact SUV, if not the most exciting to drive. In 2015, the CR-V was updated with a more fuel-efficient engine. We also recommend the , especially in Touring or Grand Touring trim. The CX-5 has an upscale interior and excellent handling, returns good fuel economy, and is just as practical as competitors. If you want a three-row crossover, check out the with its distinctive big-wagon styling. It's one of the better-driving three-rows, with an available turbocharged V6 engine, lots of passenger space and cross-country roadtrip-worthy comfort. Another solid option is the . Its athletic road manners are complemented by comfortable seats, three usable rows and plenty of cargo capacity. Just note that its crash safety scores weren't the best. HYBRIDS There's no shortage of Toyota Priuses around, but we prefer the . It provides reasonable acceleration for a hybrid, along with a comfortable interior and ride, and it returns about 40 mpg. It's not quite as efficient as the Prius, but it's nicer to live with day to day. We're going to break one of our rules for this next one: We never featured the in an Edmunds Buying Guide, but it's a great used pick. New, it fell short of its promise of being a sporty hybrid, but as a Prius alternative it's an appealing proposition. It's more luxurious and better to drive and returns 42 mpg in combined (city and highway) driving. TRUCKS AND VANS While there is no end of old Ford F-150s and Chevrolet Silverados available, our pick has to be the . This rugged, durable truck offers a burly V8 that can tow up to 10,000 pounds. Unless you're a patient bargain hunter, you might have to opt for a slightly higher-mileage Tundra, but we think the extra miles are worth it for such a capable truck. Buyers looking for something smaller should check out the Tundra's popular little brother, the Tacoma. If you need to haul people rather than bricks, the is your best bet. Compared to its predecessor, the redesigned 2011 Odyssey sports more interior space and offers more upgrades including a premium stereo, chilled storage box and rear-seat entertainment system. Pre-2011 Odysseys are great choices, too. EDMUNDS SAYS: No matter which vehicle you choose, remember to do your research to make sure you're getting the best used car for your money. You'll be able to find some cars on our list with certified pre-owned warranties, but checking vehicle history reports and having an independent inspection done will give you added peace of mind. ___ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

May's office said in a terse statement that the prime minister had accepted Johnson's resignation and would name a replacement soon. Johnson, one of the best-known and most flamboyant members of the government, quit just hours after the resignation late Sunday of Brexit Secretary David Davis, the government's top Brexit official.

Draghi told the European parliament today that the bank had decided to phase out its 2.4 trillion-euro ($2.8 trillion), three-year stimulus program at year-end because inflation is finally trending in line with the ECB's goal of just under 2 percent.

780,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Automakers Daimler and BMW have agreed to merge their transportation services businesses so they can expand offerings in ride-hailing apps, car-sharing, parking, and charging electric cars. The two companies said Wednesday they aim to become a ""leading provider"" of new ways to get around cities, where more people will see cars as a service they use when needed. Those businesses include car-sharing, an area where Stuttgart-based Daimler AG operates its car2go service and Munich-headquartered BMW AG has DriveNow. Customers use a smartphone app to find and unlock cars parked on city streets and use them for short periods when needed. Also part of the deal is Daimler's moovel startup, which allows users to book and pay for trains, cars, taxis and rental bikes. BMW's digital parking service enables ticketless, cashless on-street parking and helps uses find spaces in garages. The combined business would also offer charging services for battery-powered cars. So far, electric cars have only a small market share due to higher cost, limited range and lack of places to charge. Once electrics become as cheap or cheaper than conventional cars, their market share could expand quickly, and with it the demand for charging. The 50-50 joint venture requires approval from regulators. The companies did not say what its name, headquarters, or annual revenue would be, or what executives would run it. Auto companies are developing services businesses to fend off competition from industry outsiders such as Uber and Lyft. Volkswagen has set up services company Moia, aiming to develop and offer on-demand mobility; General Motors is operating its Maven car-sharing app. ""As pioneers in automotive engineering, we will not leave the task of shaping future urban mobility to others,"" Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said in a statement.

The dpa news agency reported that the Munich-based company said Monday it is ""not in a position to completely absorb the tariff increases.""

904,"BEIJING (AP) — European companies that export from China are changing the global flow of their goods to avoid higher American tariffs, a business group said Tuesday, as the impact of the U.S.-Chinese trade war spreads. Tariff hikes are ""hitting immediately the bottom line"" of companies that rely on the free flow of trade across countries, said Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. Companies are ""scrambling to readjust supply chains"" so U.S.-bound goods don't pass through China, Harborn said at a news conference. He said one has shifted final assembly of goods to a newly created American unit. The Trump administration's tariff hike on medical equipment, electronics and other goods from China apply to exports made by U.S. or European companies as well as Chinese suppliers. Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of goods in response to complaints Beijing is hurting American companies by stealing or pressuring enterprises to hand over technology. European governments have criticized President Donald Trump's approach but have resisted Chinese efforts to recruit them as allies in their dispute. Tariffs are a ""dangerous and very blunt instrument,"" Harborn said. ""We share the concerns expressed by the American side,"" he said. ""But there are better and less risky ways to deal with these problems."" Also Tuesday, China stepped up action against some U.S. goods by announcing anti-dumping duties raw materials used in making optical fibers. Optical fiber preforms from the United States and Japan will face additional duties of 37.9 to 78.2 percent for five years, the Ministry of Commerce announced. Chinese leaders have emphasized the benefits to foreign companies from trading with the world's second-largest economy in an effort to deflect pressure to change industrial plans communist leaders see as a route to prosperity and global influence. On Monday, Chinese and German companies including BASF and Volkswagen signed business deals worth 20 billion euros ($23.6 billion) during a visit to Berlin by China's No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang. Harborn said a European supplier of environmental technology believed it might have been awarded a Chinese government contract ahead of an American competitor due to its non-U.S. status. Also Monday, German automaker BMW AG said it would raise prices on U.S.-built SUVs exported China due to higher tariffs. Beijing's increases include an additional 25 percent tariff on cars imported from the United States, raising the total charge to 40 percent.

907,"BERLIN (AP) — German automaker Daimler AG has lowered its 2018 earnings outlook, a change that it says is partly due to increased import tariffs for U.S. vehicles in China. The company said late Wednesday that it now sees fewer SUV sales and higher costs at its Mercedes-Benz Cars division than previously expected, as a result of the tariffs, and ""this effect cannot be fully compensated by the reallocation of vehicles to other markets."" Daimler produces vehicles in the U.S. It added that earnings at the Mercedes-Benz Vans division will be hit by the recall of diesel vehicles. It said it now expects full-year earnings before interest and taxes to come in slightly below last year's level, compared with its previous forecast of a slight increase. Daimler's shares were down 3.3 percent in early Frankfurt trading Thursday at 58.71 euros ($67.97). Shares in Germany's other big automakers also were off following their rival's profit warning, with Volkswagen sliding 1.5 percent to 152.51 euros and BMW declining 1.9 percent to 81.83 euros.",1004,1006,Auto Brand,538
925,"The period between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s was a high point for classic muscle-car performance. Fifty years later, the latest batch of American performance cars is taking that reputation to new heights and leaving the rest of the world's automakers in their dust. That modern cars can outperform their forebears isn't exactly news. Advances in engine power, tire grip and suspension design have brought street-car performance to levels unknown 50 years ago. A more interesting comparison is Detroit's 2018 muscle cars — or pony cars, if you prefer — to other automakers' performance coupes. PERFORMANCE Even base versions of the 2018 Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang are impressive. The base Mustang cranks out 310 horsepower. Moving up to a Mustang GT with its V8 engine provides a thumping 460 horsepower. It's a similar story with the Camaro and the Challenger. The V8 versions of these cars all can go from zero to 60 mph in about 4.5 seconds or less. Handling ability, which was rarely a classic muscle-car forte, is now among the best in the business. At Edmunds, for example, we've rated the Camaro's steering and handling abilities slightly higher overall than those of the BMW's high-performance M4 coupe. The Camaro is just as satisfying and engaging to drive along a deserted curvy road, if not more so. SPECIAL EDITIONS Not enough raw power for you? No problem. There have always been special versions of muscle cars. Topping the list is the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon. This limited-edition variant boasts a maximum 840 horsepower and various modifications to improve straight-line acceleration. It's one of the quickest-accelerating factory production cars ever, going from zero to 60 mph in about 2.3 seconds and clearing the quarter-mile on a dragstrip in less than 10 seconds. Ford and Chevy also have their own top-shelf versions meant for road course performance. The Mustang-based Shelby GT350 has a specially tuned suspension, super-sticky tires and a high-revving V8 that would make a Ferrari jealous. It's a similar story with the Camaro ZL1 1LE. At Car and Driver magazine's most recent annual Lightning Lap racetrack test, this 650-horsepower Camaro posted a lap time quicker than just about every other car ever tested, including exotics such as the McLaren 570S. VALUE Whether you're looking at an $83,295 Demon or just a basic coupe or convertible, you're getting value. The Camaro, Challenger and Mustang all start at around $27,000. The V8-powered versions typically cost about $7,000 to $10,000 more. To get similar performance, you'll have to look to European automakers. Japan has largely gotten out of the rear-wheel-drive performance-car market. But these Euro cars cost a lot more. A 354-horsepower Audi S5, which is the brand's sport-tuned coupe, starts at about $55,000. A basic entry-level 2018 Porsche 911, which has 370 horsepower, costs close to $100,000. While the Europeans have undeniably richer interiors and pedigrees, Detroit's latest muscle cars aren't low-tech knuckle draggers. Inside, all feature large infotainment screens that are easy to use and come with smartphone connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. And while the cars are not fuel-economy champs, the base versions of the Camaro and the Mustang come with turbocharged four-cylinder engines that are good for more than 30 mpg on the highway. WHAT'S COMING NEXT In the short term, this new golden age shows no sign of dimming. For 2019, Ford will debut the latest Bullitt version of the Mustang, paying homage to the fearless chase car from the 1968 Steve McQueen movie. Chevrolet says that the 2019 Camaro will be restyled and updated with new features. There's no official news on the Challenger, but Dodge has a history of keeping it fresh with frequent updates. EDMUNDS SAYS: The latest American muscle cars are the best yet. Whether you're looking at a base Mustang or a heavily modified Camaro or Challenger, they offer unbeatable performance value. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

BMW Korea Chairman Kim Hyo-joon said Monday the German carmaker will fully cooperate with the transport ministry's investigation and complete emergency safety inspections on vehicles by next week. BMW said it found the cause of the engine fires was a leakage in their exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers. That caused fires when vehicles were driven at a high speed for a long time.

931,"The Model 3 is Tesla's most affordable electric car, with a promised starting price of $35,000. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have put down a $1,000 deposit for one. Almost all of them are still waiting for the chance to order. At Edmunds, however, we've purchased and taken delivery of one of the first Model 3s out. And we've driven it more than 3,000 miles so far. It's not our first Tesla; we've previously bought and conducted 18-month tests of the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV. We've sampled most other electric vehicles on the market, too. Here's what we can say so far about living with our Tesla Model 3 sedan: SERVICE AND QUALITY: A WORK IN PROCESS We're going to get this out of the way first: Tesla's scramble to increase its Model 3 production seems to have adversely affected Model 3 build quality, at least on the basis of our tiny sample of one. Body panel gaps are inconsistent, reflecting a lack of attention to detail, and this applies not only to our own car but even to Model 3s we've seen on display. After we brought ours home, we discovered it also had a cracked vanity mirror and a broken driver's seat shell. In our first six weeks, we've had to do the equivalent of a Windows PC's Ctrl-Alt-Del reboot of the all-important touchscreen about a dozen times. We've called a Tesla service center about the problems but have had difficulty getting an appointment. Drive-ups were not welcome, so our parts were ordered based on photographs alone. Weeks later, we're still waiting for word and it's hard to get answers. YOU BETTER LIKE TOUCHSCREENS The Model 3's minimalist interior is dominated by its huge central touchscreen. There are no gauges, no knobs and no switches except for door-mounted window controls. It looks clean and futuristic, but ease of use isn't as stellar. Certain controls are accessed from a couple of multi-axis roller buttons on the steering wheel. For just about everything else, you'll be reaching for the touchscreen to access wiper controls, adjust cruise control speed, and even to switch between modes on the audio system. You get used to it, but this approach increases the chances of driver distraction. The Model 3 doesn't play well with smartphones either. It lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two systems that easily integrate many of your phone's apps with the vehicle. And its USB ports cannot deliver any music, audiobook or podcast files from your phone to the audio system. The only way to listen to your media files is to stream them using Bluetooth audio. DRIVES GREAT, RANGE IS APPEALING Those issues aside, we enjoy driving the Model 3. It feels sorted and sporty when you're driving around turns, and the electric motor delivers plenty of thrust. It's dramatically quicker and more engaging to drive than other popular EVs such as the BMW i3 and the Chevrolet Bolt. That premium feel experienced in the Model S and the Model X is also present. Currently, Tesla is only building rear-wheel-drive Model 3 sedans with the expensive 310-mile long-range battery. The smaller battery and its purported 220-mile range and $35,000 price are still some months away. Edmunds paid $56,000 for its fully loaded Model 3. At first, we were ready to conclude it's not worth paying more for the big battery. In a regular gasoline car, 300 miles feels like a minimum because no one likes to stop for gas often. By contrast, you can charge an electric car at home every night, and at that point 220 miles is more than enough for daily use. But there are reasons to go big. Of course, it's an advantage for those who drive farther than average or can't charge every day. But it also has to do with charging speed at Tesla's network of Superchargers. If you've got a Model 3 with the bigger battery, you won't need to spend as much time hooked up to a Supercharger station. Because charge rates slow down as batteries get closer to full, it actually takes less time to bring a 310-mile battery up to 200 miles of range — which is likely all you'll need to get to the next station — than doing the same with the smaller 220-mile battery. The difference could amount to 15 minutes or more per stop, which could really add up during an extended road trip. EDMUNDS SAYS: Tesla does things differently, which is both a strength and a weakness. The new Model 3 sets a new standard for what an affordable electric vehicle can be. But initial problems highlight Tesla's inexperience with mass-market production. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

943,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Automaker Daimler says it has suspended an executive who represented it at an industry-backed organization that commissioned diesel exhaust tests involving monkeys. A statement from Daimler AG on Wednesday did not identify by name the executive, citing privacy concerns. It said the executive sat on the top management board of the now-dissolved EUGT entity. The tests have been criticized by politicians, environmentalists and animal welfare activists. Volkswagen on Tuesday suspended its head of external relations, who said he knew about the experiments but did not inform the company's then-CEO, Martin Winterkorn. The tests carried about by a lab in New Mexico involved exposing monkeys to diluted exhaust gases from a Volkswagen diesel in an attempt to measure the success of diesel technology in lowering harmful emissions. The New York Times has reported the car was rigged to lower emissions during testing. Automaker BMW said its representative on the EUGT board had been relieved from his current duties but had not been fired. The employee had ""given credible assurances, that he had critically questioned the commissioning of animal experiments.""

977,"The Audi Q5 and the BMW X3 are two of the most popular compact luxury SUVs out today. Shoppers are typically drawn to the Q5 and the X3 because of their appealing mix of refinement, utility, safety and performance. Sales of both models in the United States easily surpass the companies' comparably priced Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series sedans, in fact. Picking which one to buy can be difficult, however. Both models start at around $41,000 and offer a comprehensive set of features. Edmunds takes a look to find out which one has an edge. TWO OF A KIND The Q5 and the X3 are both fully redesigned for the 2018 model year. Based on a casual glance at the spec sheet, you'd likely think Audi's and BMW's engineers were handed the same blueprints. Each SUV comes standard with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes about 250 horsepower and returns 25 mpg combined. They're also available in performance-oriented models that have larger and more powerful six-cylinder engines that generate more than 350 horsepower. Inside, the Q5 and the X3 seat up to five passengers and have enough rear passenger space to meet the typical requirements of a small family. The Q5 offers 26.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, while the X3 offers 28.7 cubic feet. The BMW maintains its slim lead when you fold down the rear seats. Each SUV has four-year/50,000-mile basic and powertrain warranties. Audi pays for the Q5's first scheduled maintenance, but BMW goes further and covers the X3's scheduled services for three years or 36,000 miles. DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS The Audi Q5 and the BMW X3 provide a comfortable ride and secure handling on a variety of road surfaces. You can also fit them with an optional driver-adjustable and adaptive suspension that can soften the ride or firm it up for sportier handling. This feature is optional on all X3s, but Audi offers it on the priciest Q5 trim level only. When driving with more enthusiasm, we've found the X3 is a little more agile and engaging to drive than the Q5. In regards to safety, each model has top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for crash protection and effectiveness of crash avoidance technologies. But some of those crash avoidance features are easier to get on the BMW. For example, you can get lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control on any version of the X3, but on the Q5 they're only available on the priciest trim level. BMW gives you a little more choice in powertrains, too. The X3 is available with rear-wheel drive, whereas the Q5 comes standard with all-wheel drive. This rear-wheel-drive X3 configuration costs slightly less and improves combined fuel economy by 1 mpg. When it comes to towing, the Q5 and the X3 both offer 4,400-pound capacities. All X3s have an optional, factory-installed Class 3 hitch receiver that comes with integrated connecting hardware. The Q5 offers a similar setup, but only as a dealer-installed accessory on midgrade and higher trim levels. INSIDE LOOK Interior differences mostly relate to style. Both interiors offer large entertainment screens and high-resolution digital gauge clusters that host a range of adjustments. The X3's digital instrument cluster incorporates physical gauge housings into its screen, giving it a traditional appearance. The Q5's large panel looks modern and offers more dramatic configurations, including the ability to display the navigation map across the entire screen. Overall, we think the Audi's controls are easier to use, and the quality of its interior materials is higher. Another difference is smartphone integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. These systems can display select apps from your phone directly onto the car's infotainment screens. The X3 only supports Apple CarPlay, so Android users are out of luck. The Q5 comes with both. But iPhone owners will appreciate how cleanly their phone is integrated into the X3's infotainment system. The Q5's system lack of touchscreen functionality makes these systems more cumbersome to use at times. EDMUNDS SAYS: Choosing between the Q5 and the X3 is difficult. They are comparably priced, deliver a pleasing driving experience and offer a comprehensive set of features. If you're looking for more flexibility to get the features you want without paying for stuff that you don't, the BMW X3 may be for you. If you're after a nicer interior and a more appealing infotainment system, the Audi Q5 could be your SUV of choice. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

988,"NEW YORK (AP) — Unplug and go. Filling up a car is as simple as that, even if it's not gas flowing through the nozzle. Electricity is efficient. Formula E, a global electric auto racing series, steers the way — toward the future of not only its sport but also its industry. ""You don't realize it,"" Mahindra Racing team principal Dilbagh Gill said, ""but the second car from today that you're going to buy is going to be an electric car."" America is one of Formula E's biggest targets. So, for the second consecutive time since the series' inception in 2014, Formula E took on the Brooklyn streets for a season-finale doubleheader of its 12-race schedule. The track length is 2.373 kilometers with Lower Manhattan in the backdrop as well as the Statue of Liberty. Techeetah's Jean-Eric Vergne became the fourth different driver to win the championship and Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler took home the overall team title. Confetti at the finish line marked the end of an era. In January, Formula E unveiled its new Gen2 car for next season. The current cars have a maximum power of 200kW, limited to 180kW during races, and they top out at 225 kph (140 mph). This model has been around since the series started and requires a mid-race car change because the battery runs out. The Gen2 car will run faster and longer. No more swaps. Performance has basically been doubled in just four years without changing the battery's fundamental chemistry. ""I don't know if you remember before Formula E started, there was this whole perception that lithium batteries were a little bit dangerous — they were prohibited on airplanes, they caught fire on mobile phones,"" Panasonic Jaguar Racing sporting manager Gary Ekerold said. ""Since we've run Formula E ... absolutely fine. Batteries are proven to be safe."" But they're still monitored. A dielectric — non-conductor — fluid in the battery keeps it cool while the car runs. There's also a battery management system that constantly records data, monitoring temperature and voltage. When the car is charging, dry-ice blowers — Super Chillers — connect to the car and prevent overheating. It takes less than an hour to recharge a drained battery. ""It's going to start reaching a stage where the time it takes to fill up your gas — 4 minutes and 40 seconds on average — is going to be the time it takes to charge your car,"" Gill said. Teams are given identical batteries. The chassis, or bodies, of the cars are also the same. Where teams can get creative are places such as the electric motor, inverter, powertrain and gearbox. Manufacturers get involved here. Everyday car names occupy pit lane. Audi and Jaguar already have teams. Nissan and BMW will next season. Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are joining for season six. ""This is like a playground for them,"" Mahindra Racing driver Feliz Rosenqvist said. ""When you get to the competitive side, you can always find new ways that maybe you wouldn't do on a normal car. You push the software and hardware."" The steering wheel, which has a programmable screen, is also fair game. Things can get technical when the car gets broken down into specific parts and technology is thrown into the mix. But the basics remain: Energy is how far. Power is how fast. ""It's still a racing car,"" Panasonic Jaguar Racing driver Mitch Evans said. ""It looks like a racing car. It drives like a racing car."" It just doesn't sound like the normal racing car. The roar of a combustion engine is missing. ""That's normally like a sensor for your driving — how quick you're going, how you hear the revs — and now you can only hear the wind,"" Rosenqvist said. ""It's more like riding a bike. As you increase your speed, you just start hearing wind."" To spectators, the whizzing equates to an amplified toy car, go-kart or scooter. All electric, of course. It's not that disruptive to the public. Electric cars are the way of the future. They're already racing on city streets. They go rain or shine — only stop for thunder or lightning. And they're much better for the environment. ""Your whole life runs on a battery,"" Gill said. ""The time is now.""",2672,2674,Auto Brand,546

1001,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Automaker Daimler AG saw first-quarter net profit fall 11 percent due to shifting currency exchange rates and one-time gains in the year-earlier quarter. But the company had stronger earnings from its Mercedes-Benz luxury car division and raised its profit forecast for the year, saying earnings will increase slightly even as it spends heavily on new technology. The previous outlook was for earnings about the same as last year's. For the first quarter, net profit was 2.35 billion euros ($2.85 billion), down from 2.65 billion euros a year earlier, when the company's Mitsubishi Fuso truck business sold real estate worth 267 million euros. It also booked a gain a year earlier from the revaluation of the company's stake in Chinese partner BAIC Motor Corporation. Currency exchange rate shifts had a ""slightly negative"" effect on earnings, the company said Friday. CEO Dieter Zetsche pointed to a 7 percent increase in vehicle unit sales in the quarter, to 807,000 vehicles worldwide. ""We are sustainably continuing along our profitable growth course and sold more vehicles than ever before in a first quarter,"" he said. Daimler is counting on continued strong profits to fund its investments in new technologies expected to reshape the auto industry. Those include electric and autonomous vehicles and increasing use of cars as a temporary service. The company pushed in that direction by agreeing in March to combine its mobility service division including its car-sharing business with BMW's services business. Revenue increased 3 percent to 39.78 billion euros ($48.2 billion) and the Mercedes division's profit rose 3 percent. Strong sales of the flagship S-Class luxury sedan and sport-utility vehicles boosted earnings at the division.  The division's return on sales — a key measure of profitability — increased to 9.0 percent from 8.9 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Profits slipped however at the company's van and bus divisions. ___ This story has been corrected to give the spelling of the CEO as Zetsche, instead of Zetsch.",1519,1521,Auto Brand,547

1023,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union says it is already preparing measures to retaliate against the United States if President Donald Trump puts tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. The auto industry is a big employer and exporter in Europe, and the new tariffs could hit the region hard, as well as consumers and manufacturers in the U.S., where prices would rise. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said Thursday that the 28-nation bloc would be forced to impose more ""rebalancing measures"" if Trump escalates existing trade tensions with the auto tariffs. U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imports took effect on June 1; the EU responded by imposing duties on American products. ""If the U.S. would impose these car tariffs that would be very unfortunate,"" said Malmstrom. She said the EU was preparing ""a list of rebalancing measures there as well. And this we have made clear to our American partners."" Malmstrom and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will visit Trump next week at a time of worsening relations with Washington. During a visit to Europe last week, Trump time and again rebuked the EU for being an unfair trading partner and called the bloc a ""foe."" Juncker said Thursday night he was ""surprised"" to hear Trump describe Europe in such a hostile way. ""I grew up innocently thinking the United States and Europe were like brothers,"" Juncker said during a speech in Madrid. The EU says it does have higher tariffs on cars than the U.S. — around 10 percent versus 2 percent — but those tariffs only apply to about 15 percent of the car market. The U.S. has higher tariffs on trucks and other products, the EU says. The EU officials' July 25 visit will seek to contain the damage and Malmstrom will be trying to make sure that the trade conflict does not spread into the lucrative automobile sector too. Malmstrom acknowledged, however, that the U.S.-EU meeting ""can be a bit unpredictable."" Earlier this month, the EU published an analysis of the potential economic impact of U.S. tariffs on the auto industry and estimated that it could lead the EU and other U.S. trade partners to retaliate with tariffs on $294 billion worth of American goods, or about 19 percent of total U.S. exports. It noted that EU car companies are big employers in the U.S., providing jobs to about half a million people through direct employment and dealerships. The tariffs, the bloc said, would hurt U.S. GDP by between $13 billion to $14 billion. For Europe, there is a lot at stake as companies like BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen, and Fiat Chrysler send $46.6 billion worth of vehicles every year to the U.S. Some 13.3 million people, or 6.1 percent of the employed population of the EU, work in the automotive sector, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.",2524,2526,Auto Brand,550

1048,"NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices and energy companies rallied Friday after OPEC said it will produce more oil, but not as much as investors feared. While trade tensions remained in the headlines, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher at the end of a bumpy week. U.S. crude futures jumped 4.6 percent after OPEC nations agreed to produce about 1 million additional barrels of oil per day. Reports have said for weeks that production was likely to rise, but analysts said investors appear to think the boost will be smaller than OPEC says it will. So oil prices rallied even though they usually go down when production rises. ""People were pricing crude in the last couple of weeks (expecting) a bigger increase by OPEC than what they agreed to,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group.

Automakers were jolted after President Donald Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tax on cars imported from Europe, although none of them took big losses. The S&P 500 index rose as much as 14 points but ended with a gain of just 5.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,754.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 119.19 points, or 0.5 percent, to 24,580.89 to break an eight-day losing streak. The Dow lost 2 percent this week, with Boeing off 5.3 percent and Caterpillar down 6.7 percent. That was both companies' biggest loss in three months. Makers of chemicals and other basic materials like 3M also lost ground this week and technology companies slipped. The Nasdaq composite fell 20.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,692.82. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 3.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,685.58. U.S. crude climbed 4.6 percent to $68.58 a barrel in New York. That was its biggest one-day gain since November 2016, when OPEC and a group of other countries including Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day. Prices have been rising since then, and U.S. crude hit a three-year high of about $72 a barrel in May. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 3.4 percent to $75.55 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil picked up 2.1 percent to $81.38 and Marathon Oil surged 7.8 percent to $21.48. The European Union is enforcing tariffs on $3.4 billion in U.S. products in retaliation for duties the Trump administration has put on European steel and aluminum. The taxes are on American products including bourbon, peanut butter and orange juice, and the choices appear designed to create political pressure on Trump and senior U.S. politicians. EU authorities had said the move was coming in response to the U.S. import duties. On Twitter, Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tax on cars imported from the EU if barriers to trade are not removed soon. He previously ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to look into possible tariffs or quotas on imported cars and car parts. That jolted car companies. In Germany, shares of BMW lost 1.1 percent and Daimler sank 0.3 percent. Daimler fell more than 4 percent Thursday after it said Chinese tariffs on U.S. cars would contribute to a decline in its earnings this year. Ford and Toyota also dipped while Peugeot and General Motors rose. ""If you're in the direct line of fire from a tariff, it's hugely important,"" said Paulsen. Still, he said investors are very skeptical that a damaging trade war will break out. ""The trade war has heated up over the last couple of months and yet stocks are up over that period of time,"" he said. That was also the case Friday. Health care and household goods companies also rose while technology companies and banks fell. Open source software maker Red Hat dropped 12.4 percent to $142.14 after it cut its sales forecasts due to the strengthening dollar. Other technology companies also declined. The industry has been leading the market for more than a year, but it makes more of its sales outside the U.S. than any other major S&P 500 sector. Micron Technology fell 3.9 percent to $57.10 and Nvidia lost 2.4 percent to $250.95. In other commodity trading, wholesale gasoline jumped 2.9 percent to $2.07 a gallon. Heating oil added 2.7 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Natural gas skidded 1 percent to $2.95 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold slid 0.3 percent to $1,270.70 an ounce. Silver added 0.8 percent to $16.46 an ounce. Copper edged up 0.2 percent to $3.03 a pound. Bond prices rose slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid to 2.89 percent. The dollar rose to 109.91 yen from 109.90 yen. The euro advanced to $1.1663 from $1.1617. The CAC 40 in France climbed 1.3 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1.7 percent. In Germany the DAX rose 0.5 percent. Some Asian markets gained following heavy losses on previous days but finished lower than a week ago. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged up 0.2 percent while Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.8 percent.

1142,"BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group said Friday it is talking with China's biggest SUV maker about a possible partnership to produce electric versions of its MINI as automakers ramp up electric development under pressure from Beijing to meet sales quotas. BMW said it signed a letter of intent with Great Wall Motors Co., headquartered in Baoding, southwest of Beijing, and needs to work out a cooperation agreement and investment details. Auto brands face pressure to meet quotas that require electric vehicles to make up at least 10 percent of sales starting next year. Later, they face pressure to raise that to meet increasingly demanding fuel efficiency standards. Beijing is using access to its auto market, the world's largest, as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other electric vehicle technology. Foreign automakers that want to manufacture in China must do so through local partners, which requires them to hand over know-how or help potential Chinese competitors develop their own. General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG, Nissan Motor Co. and other brands already have announced similar plans with local partners to produce dozens of electric models for China. MINI's first battery electric model is due to be produced at its main British factory in Oxford in 2019, according to BMW. ""This signals a further clear commitment to the electrified future of the MINI brand,"" BMW said in a statement. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. China is BMW's biggest market. The Munich-based automaker said about 560,000 BMW brand vehicles were delivered to Chinese customers in 2017, more than its next two markets — the United States and Germany — combined. China was MINI's fourth-largest market in 2017, with 35,000 vehicles delivered, the company said. An electrics venture with BMW would be a boost for Great Wall, which industry analysts have warned will struggle to satisfy Beijing's sales quotas and had yet to announce any significant electric plans. Great Wall sells more than 1 million fuel-hungry SUVs annually. That sets a high baseline for electric sales and will make it harder to meet fleet average efficiency standards. ___ BMW Group: Great Wall Motors Co.:",15,17,Auto Brand,553

AUTO SHOW-WHEELS TO WATCH New Jetta, SUVs and peek at future cars at Detroit auto show DETROIT (AP) — It's the year of the pickup truck at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford unveil new trucks in a fast-growing and highly competitive U.S. auto market. But there are plenty of other vehicles at the show, which is one of the industry's largest. Mercedes and BMW have new SUVs, while several Japanese automakers are showing off prototypes of future vehicles. It's all happening in a U.S. auto market that's shrinking but still expected to remain at healthy levels. Last year sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million, still near record highs. Analysts expect sales to be just under 17 million in 2018. AUTO SHOW-CHINA IS COMING China's GAC to scrap Trump-sounding brand for US market DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automaker GAC Motor will scrap the brand name it uses in China when it enters the U.S. market next year because it could be confused with President Donald Trump's surname. For the past eight years, GAC has sold cars and SUVs under the brand Trumpchi in its home market, but is now researching new names before the company's expected U.S. debut in the fourth quarter of 2019. Wang Qiujing, president of GAC Engineering Institute China, said through an interpreter in an interview at the Detroit auto show that GAC picked the Chinese name Trumpchi in 2010, well before Trump was elected. Hee says the similarity to Trump is just a coincidence. GAC will continue to use Trumpchi in China, where the word means legend and good fortune. GAC's first vehicle in the U.S. will be the GS8, a loaded-out full-size SUV that will cost about $35,000. Two more vehicles are being researched for U.S. sales, but have not been selected yet. TRUMP-PANAMA FIGHT Panama Hotel votes to drop Trump — but his company won't go WASHINGTON (AP) — An attempt to oust President Donald Trump's hotel business from managing a luxury hotel in Panama has turned bitter, with accusations of financial misconduct. Trump Hotels is contesting its firing, and its staff ran off a team of Marriott executives invited last month to visit the property during a search for a new hotel operator, according to two people familiar with the matter. After the owners' association accused Trump Hotels of mismanagement and financial misconduct in a $15 million arbitration claim, the company owned by the president fired back with a $200 million counterclaim and refused to turn over the property's financial records. When a team from Marriott International Inc. came to the property at the invitation of the hotel's majority owner, Trump staff asked them to leave, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what happened behind the scenes. The two people say the head of Trump Hotels, Eric Danziger, also called Marriott chief executive Arne Sorenson to complain about the visit. Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten said the call was not intended to pressure Marriott. A spokeswoman for Marriott declined to comment.

Those are smaller gaps than in the overall work force. The bank's head of human resources said Monday it told employees it will raise compensation this year to help close the gaps.

1257,"BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales rose 7.9 percent in May from a year earlier as purchases of electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled to 102,000, an industry group reported Tuesday. Sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans rose to 1.9 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 9.6 percent to 2.3 million. Year-to-date sales rose 5.1 percent to 9.9 million, rebounding from 2017's annual growth of just 1.4 percent. Sales of electric and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 126 percent over a year earlier. Through May, sales of electrics and hybrids rose 142 percent to 328,000. Beijing has spent heavily to transform China into the world's biggest electric car market and is preparing to enforce sales quotas to press global automakers to speed up development. The Finance Ministry says auto import duties will be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent on most vehicles, effective July 1. That followed pledges to buy more U.S. goods and end restrictions on foreign ownership in the industry. Ford Motor Co. responded by announcing a cut in prices of imported models. But industry analysts say automakers including Ford, General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG are likely to gain little in sales, because most of their vehicles sold in China are produced in local factories.

1318,"The average transaction price for new vehicles has been hovering above $35,000 this year, and briefly broke $36,000 at the end of 2017. But instead of buying a new vehicle, what if you took that money and applied it to purchasing a late-model luxury vehicle? For about the same money or less, you can typically get more interior refinement and comfort, better performance, and a vehicle that generally feels more special. Here are examples of six excellent used luxury cars. We've forgone a lot of the obvious entry-level choices such as the BMW 3 Series. For this list, we collected vehicles that are more unique and upscale. Even better, these cars are available as certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles, meaning buyers can get extended warranty coverage and take advantage of manufacturer financing deals that often offer low interest rates. Some companies are even beginning to offer CPO leases, which are perfect for shoppers who aren't yet ready to jump into used luxury-car ownership. SEDANS 2014-2017 With strong acceleration, excellent handling and an attractive cabin, the Cadillac CTS has what it takes to rival Europe's best sedans. Its touch-based controls can be frustrating to use, but this capable, sporty luxury sedan has more strengths than weaknesses. Keep an eye out for V6 and V-Sport models for a performance boost. From 2016 onward, smartphone connectivity and a rearview camera were standard. The CTS is a premium experience, and you'll find plenty of CPO examples for $30,000 or less. 2015-2016 The 2015 and 2016 Hyundai Genesis are very similar to their successor, the Genesis G80 sedan. Because of the name change when Hyundai spun off the Genesis brand, examples that still bear the Hyundai name are amazing bargains. Don't let the Hyundai badge fool you: The Genesis is a true luxury competitor. It has a comfortable interior trimmed in premium materials, easy-to-use tech features that you'd expect from a luxury car, and a choice of two strong engines. CPO prices are mostly under $30,000. 2014-2016 Few sedans exemplify a proper luxury sedan better than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. For around $36,000, you can find 2014 to 2016 E350 sedans. These were the last years of the previous -generation model. They don't have the ultra-impressive interior design of the newest E-Class, but they offer the same luxury and brand cachet. We picked the 2014 model year as our starting point because Mercedes updated it with slick new looks, interior tweaks, and a new suite of active safety features. Factor in these updates to the E350's superb ride quality, comfortable interior and solid-performing V6 engine, and you have an appealing and well-rounded luxury car. There's a big price spread, with older models starting around $26,000, while 2016 cars can still go for more than $35,000. SUVs 2016-2017 Thanks to its strong V6 engine, sporty handling, a long list of tech features, and a good amount of cargo space, the Acura RDX is an appealing compact luxury SUV. Slightly older models are still a good bet, but Acura improved the RDX's infotainment interface for 2016 and added a handful of active safety features and extra standard equipment. The RDX is a practical and rewarding choice, and it comes from a brand with a history of good reliability. Like the Mercedes, depending on age and equipment, the RDX can range from $25,000 to $35,000. 2014-2016 The midsize X5 really set the standard for the current crop of road-focused luxury SUVs, blending refinement and performance with utility and technology. A variety of engines areis available, including a high-torque diesel. We also like the X5's comfortable seating, steadfast stability, and wide spectrum of available features. A folding third-row seat is optional, though it's really only suitable for children. Expect to pay more than $30,000 for a good example. SUV ALTERNATIVE 2012-2016 To make the versatile XC70, Volvo took its practical and comfortable V70 wagon, raised its ride height and added all-wheel drive. Find a model with either the turbocharged inline-six or the turbocharged inline-five cylinder engine, and you'll have ample power to go with the ample cargo area and Volvo's excellent ergonomics. For 2012, Volvo improved the XC70's technology features, making that the year to start your search. The XC70 was discontinued after 2016, so the pool of CPO examples is shrinking. If you're looking for a versatile vehicle without as many compromises as an SUV, take a look at an XC70 before it disappears forever. Expect to pay around $28,000 to $32,000, although recent, higher trim-level versions can be pricier. EDMUNDS SAYS: Entry-level luxury cars have always been an appealing option for shoppers, but many buyers may not realize that all sorts of late-model luxury options are available for less than the average price of a new vehicle. Certified pre-owned examples can offer shoppers warranty and financing benefits that are similar to that of new cars, making them even more viable alternatives to brand-new vehicles. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1334,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen's new CEO said Friday that the automaker must ""significantly step up the pace"" as it pushes into electric and self-driving vehicle technologies and shakes up its culture in the wake of a scandal over diesel emissions. Herbert Diess said a new management structure bundling the company's dozen brands in just three divisions would mean faster decisions as the company implements a broad strategy aimed at keeping up with changes in how people use cars. The 59-year-old Diess was named Thursday as the German automaker's new boss, replacing longtime insider Matthias Mueller. Diess came to Volkswagen only two years ago from competitor BMW and takes over with a mandate to press changes in the company's insular management culture. As CEO, Diess will also be responsible for the company's mass market brands Volkswagen, SEAT and Skoda, as well as digital services and vehicle software. Luxury group Audi will be placed in a separate premium division and high-end brands Porsche, Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini in a super-premium group. Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said Diess would have a chief operating officer to oversee day to day issues at the volume segment so that he would not lose focus on the company has a whole. That executive has not been named. Speaking at a news conference at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, Diess said the company's goal would be ""to forcefully and with focus press ahead"" with the company's Strategy 2025. The plan involves adding 30 battery-powered vehicles by 2025 and tapping new revenue possibilities by focusing on offering temporary use of autos as a service. The strategy also includes building a more open, values-based culture to avoid the cheating that took place under Martin Winterkorn, who resigned when the scandal broke in 2015. Eight managers were charged with criminal offenses in the United States and the company paid more than $20 billion in fines, settlements and penalties. In Europe, the scandal dealt a serious blow to sales of cars with diesel engines, as the heightened scrutiny revealed that other manufacturers also sold cars that polluted far more during regular driving than during testing, although not necessarily using the same illegal methods that Volkswagen did. Mueller, who had headed Porsche, took over from Winterkorn when he resigned because of the scandal in September 2015. Despite the high costs in reputation and fines, the company under Mueller's two-year stewardship achieved record sales of 10.74 million vehicles in 2017 and made 11.6 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in profit. Poetsch said that the company has ""to a great extent put the diesel crisis behind us."" Diesel matters could still haunt the company, since two different sets of German prosecutors, in the cities of Braunschweig and Munich, are still investigating possible wrongdoing. As an outsider who didn't come up through the Volkswagen ranks as did Mueller, Diess must master the company's unique and sometimes unwieldy corporate culture, which includes a major government stakeholder in the state of Lower Saxony and strong employee representation that has tended to hinder cost-cutting. When Diess came to Volkswagen in 2015 from competitor BMW, his first job was hammering out a 2016 cost-cutting agreement with the company's powerful labor representatives. The deal foresees raising German factory productivity by 25 percent and dropping 23,000 jobs through attrition but expressly rules out layoffs. The management shakeup included appointing an employee representative, Gunnar Kilian, as chief human resources manager. Analyst Max Warburton at Sanford C. Bernstein said the Kilian appointment had the appearance of concession to powerful employee representatives in return for agreeing to naming investor-friendly cost-cutter Diess as CEO. Warburton said, however, that despite fears that Volkswagen's insular culture might reject Diess's hardnosed approach, ""instead of being squeezed out he has been pushed upward and made CEO,"" calling that ""a sign of real change at VW."" ___ David Rising in Berlin contributed to this report.",671,673,Auto Brand,565

1340,"NEW YORK (AP) — Unplug and go. Filling up a car is as simple as that, even if it's not gas flowing through the nozzle. Electricity is efficient. Formula E, a global electric auto racing series, steers the way — toward the future of not only its sport but also its industry. ""You don't realize it,"" Mahindra Racing team principal Dilbagh Gill said, ""but the second car from today that you're going to buy is going to be an electric car."" America is one of Formula E's biggest targets. So, for the second consecutive time since the series' inception in 2014, Formula E took on the Brooklyn streets for a season-finale doubleheader of its 12-race schedule. The track length is 2.373 kilometers with Lower Manhattan in the backdrop as well as the Statue of Liberty. Techeetah's Jean-Eric Vergne became the fourth different driver to win the championship and Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler took home the overall team title. Confetti at the finish line marked the end of an era. In January, Formula E unveiled its new Gen2 car for next season. The current cars have a maximum power of 200kW, limited to 180kW during races, and they top out at 225 kph (140 mph). This model has been around since the series started and requires a mid-race car change because the battery runs out. The Gen2 car will run faster and longer. No more swaps. Performance has basically been doubled in just four years without changing the battery's fundamental chemistry. ""I don't know if you remember before Formula E started, there was this whole perception that lithium batteries were a little bit dangerous — they were prohibited on airplanes, they caught fire on mobile phones,"" Panasonic Jaguar Racing sporting manager Gary Ekerold said. ""Since we've run Formula E ... absolutely fine. Batteries are proven to be safe."" But they're still monitored. A dielectric — non-conductor — fluid in the battery keeps it cool while the car runs. There's also a battery management system that constantly records data, monitoring temperature and voltage. When the car is charging, dry-ice blowers — Super Chillers — connect to the car and prevent overheating. It takes less than an hour to recharge a drained battery. ""It's going to start reaching a stage where the time it takes to fill up your gas — 4 minutes and 40 seconds on average — is going to be the time it takes to charge your car,"" Gill said. Teams are given identical batteries. The chassis, or bodies, of the cars are also the same. Where teams can get creative are places such as the electric motor, inverter, powertrain and gearbox. Manufacturers get involved here. Everyday car names occupy pit lane. Audi and Jaguar already have teams. Nissan and BMW will next season. Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are joining for season six. ""This is like a playground for them,"" Mahindra Racing driver Feliz Rosenqvist said. ""When you get to the competitive side, you can always find new ways that maybe you wouldn't do on a normal car. You push the software and hardware."" The steering wheel, which has a programmable screen, is also fair game. Things can get technical when the car gets broken down into specific parts and technology is thrown into the mix. But the basics remain: Energy is how far. Power is how fast. ""It's still a racing car,"" Panasonic Jaguar Racing driver Mitch Evans said. ""It looks like a racing car. It drives like a racing car."" It just doesn't sound like the normal racing car. The roar of a combustion engine is missing. ""That's normally like a sensor for your driving — how quick you're going, how you hear the revs — and now you can only hear the wind,"" Rosenqvist said. ""It's more like riding a bike. As you increase your speed, you just start hearing wind."" To spectators, the whizzing equates to an amplified toy car, go-kart or scooter. All electric, of course. It's not that disruptive to the public. Electric cars are the way of the future. They're already racing on city streets. They go rain or shine — only stop for thunder or lightning. And they're much better for the environment. ""Your whole life runs on a battery,"" Gill said. ""The time is now.""",2672,2674,Auto Brand,546

1356,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen is trying to reassure German customers worried about the future of their diesel cars by telling them they can trade in their new diesel if it is banned from the road by cities trying to meet air pollution limits. The company said Thursday that the guarantee applies to new cars bought from a Volkswagen dealer from April 1 through the end of the year, and would be good for three years. If the car owner is hit with a ban on driving at work or at home, the car could go back to the dealer for a non-banned model. The German courts have ruled that cities with high pollution levels can ban diesel cars from circulation. That follows the scandal in 2015 in which Volkswagen rigged its diesel cars to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. In the wake of the scandal, other carmakers' diesel models were found also to have higher emissions during regular driving than during test procedures through use of regulatory loopholes. Environmental groups have pressed cities with high pollution levels to impose bans and diesel sales have fallen in the wake of the negative news. The newest diesels must meet pollution standards during regular driving conditions as well as on test stands. Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler say diesel engines remain a necessary part of the model lineup in order to meet tougher European Union limits on greenhouse gases. Diesels require more expensive emission controls to eliminate nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that harms health. But they emit less carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. The company says it has already taken 170,000 older diesels off the road by offering incentives to trade them in for newer, cleaner models.",1222,1224,Auto Brand,567
1359,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — BMW's profit fell 6 percent in the second quarter as it spent more on developing new technologies for electric, autonomous and digitally connected automobiles, the luxury carmaker said Thursday. Net income came in at 2.08 billion euros ($2.42 billion), down from 2.22 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues fell 2.9 percent to 25.02 billion euros. The company said it spent 2.61 billion euros on research and development over the first six months of the year, up 13.6 percent from a year earlier, and saw higher prices for raw materials. In its report, it highlighted its push into electric vehicles, saying it has sold 61,000 so far this year, an increase of 42 percent. Global automakers are spending heavily on new technologies that are changing the ways in which people get around, including ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft and car-sharing. Carmakers are trying to ward off competition from tech companies such as Waymo, which is developing autonomous vehicles. The company said its core business of selling luxury cars remained profitable, citing strong sales of its 1-Series compact car and X1 and X5 sport-utility vehicles. But the automotive profit margin, a key earnings metric, fell from 10.1 percent to 8.6 percent. That still remains within the company's target range of 8-10 percent. The company also took steps during the quarter to grow its business in China, agreeing to expand its joint venture with Brilliance Automotive. It has also agreed on a 50-50 joint venture with Great Wall Motor to make electric Mini compacts there. The company reaffirmed its financial target of unchanged group profit before tax. But investors pushed BMW shares down 2 percent after the announcement, to 79.80 euros. CEO Harald Krueger told journalists on a conference call that the recent agreement on trade between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was a ""good step."" Trump had threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on imported autos but agreed with Juncker to hold off ahead of further talks. Auto tariffs could have disrupted global automotive supply chains which frequently cross borders. ""We have to wait and see how things go in the future,"" Krueger said. He underlined that BMW remains the largest U.S. auto exporter, shipping SUVs from its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to the rest of the world. ""The trade situation was certainly volatile. I hope the talks can be carried on in a constructive dialogue."" BMW has said it will have to raise prices on U.S.-built vehicles it sends to China after Beijing raised tariffs on cars from the U.S. in retaliation against tariffs imposed by Trump. Krueger noted that BMW in any case produces 80 percent of its Chinese sales locally. The company said it was almost done certifying vehicles under the latest European standards by the Sept. 1 deadline. The new procedures require measuring emissions during real-world driving in addition to testing on stands. That contrasts with the performance of competitors Daimler and Volkswagen, both of whom have warned of production holdups. The real-world tests were instituted by the European Union after Volkswagen's scandal over illegally manipulated diesel emissions drew attention to the fact that other manufacturers' vehicles also emitted more pollution on the road than during tests.",26,28,Auto Brand,568
1363,"DETROIT (AP) — Japanese air bag maker Takata is recalling an additional 3.3 million faulty air bag inflators as it expands the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. The latest recalls cover frontal air bags in certain 2009, 2010 and 2013 vehicles made Honda, Toyota, Audi, BMW, Daimler Vans, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Tesla. Automakers will provide specific models in paperwork that will be filed later this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Notices of the expanded recalls were posted Saturday . Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 20 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection. The recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority. Many automakers have been slow to replace the potentially deadly inflators. A report by an independent monitor said that as of Sept. 15, 2017, automakers have recalled 43.1 million inflators. Of those, only 18.5 million, or 43 percent, have been replaced even though Takata recalls began in 2001. NHTSA has said the Takata recalls are unprecedented in size and complexity and have resulted in groundbreaking lessons that will help automakers reach their repair goals. The agency said it is monitoring the automakers' progress and working to expand best practices to boost completion rates. The agency also has the authority to fine automakers that don't make recall repairs in a timely manner.",278,280,Auto Brand,569
1383,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — LG Electronics Inc. said Thursday it will acquire Austrian-based automotive light maker ZKW in the company's biggest acquisition as its seeks a bigger share in the automotive components market. The South Korean company said it plans to buy a 70 percent stake in ZKW Holding, a supplier to BMW and Mercedes-Benz, for 1.4 trillion won ($1.3 billion; 1.1 billion euros). Its holding company LG Corp. will purchase the remaining stake for 330 million euros ($402 million). LG is banking on its automotive parts business to get a stronger foothold in the market. LG said the purchase of ZKW, which makes high-quality lights for top automakers around the world, will enhance its auto parts business portfolio. The South Korean company said the acquisition will also help develop advanced automotive lighting for self-driving cars and next-generation automotive lighting. Separately, LG Electronics said its January-March net profit fell 13 percent over a year earlier to 729.9 billion won ($676.4 million) on sales worth 15.1 trillion won ($14.1 billion). Operating profit jumped 20 percent over a year ago to 1.1 trillion won ($1.03 billion). While its mobile business posted a loss of 136.1 billion won ($126.9 million) during the first quarter, its high-end home appliance products and OLED TVs drove profit growth in LG's two key divisions. Its TV division in particular saw a 77 percent jump in operating income over a year ago thanks to strong demand for high-end TVs made of OLED panels and cheaper component costs.",315,317,Auto Brand,570

1406,"DETROIT (AP) — Ride-hailing company Lyft is joining with large Canadian auto parts supplier Magna to develop self-driving vehicles, sharing expenses on a multi-year project that could vault them onto the leader board in autonomous technology. The companies announced the partnership Wednesday and also said that Magna would invest $200 million in Lyft. Raj Kapoor, Lyft's chief strategy officer, says Lyft needs auto industry expertise to manufacture autonomous vehicle components and eventually build the vehicles. Automakers know how to design vehicles so they meet safety regulations and can be manufactured easily, Kapoor said. ""The auto industry has perfected all of these tools and all of those processes,"" he said. Once technology is developed, Magna would be free to sell it to other companies, which would be encouraged to place their vehicles onto Lyft's ride-sharing network, Kapoor said. The tie-up is a huge step forward for both companies, Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid says. Before the announcement, he was skeptical of Lyft's autonomous vehicle efforts because it had no manufacturing ability and very limited data to offer from its ride-hailing network. Magna, he said, knows how to build sensors and assemble engine control computers. ""They know how to do electronics,"" he said. ""They have the capability to design and develop vehicles and manufacture them.""  That can be paired with Lyft's service expertise, Abuelsamid added. The partnership pushes the companies into a group of leaders in the autonomous vehicle race, Abuelsamid says. Also in the race are Google's Waymo, General Motors' Cruise Automation, automotive tech company Aptiv, Renault-Nissan, and a Daimler AG and Bosch partnership, he said. Magna International Inc., based near Toronto, has about 168,000 employees worldwide. It also builds cars under contract in Austria for Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. By next year, Magna expects its factory in Graz to be able to build over 200,000 vehicles per year.",1885,1887,Auto Brand,572
1407,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen is seeking to reassure German customers that they can trade in their new diesel auto if the car is banned from the road by cities trying to meeting air pollution limits. The company said Thursday that the guarantee applies to new cars bought from a Volkswagen dealer from April 1 through the end of the year, and would be good for three years. The German courts have ruled that cities with high pollution levels can impose diesel driving bans. That follows Volkswagen's 2015 scandal over diesels rigged to cheat on emissions tests. Diesel sales have fallen. Volkswagen along with BMW and Daimler say that the newest diesels meet tightened emissions standards and emit less carbon dioxide, making them essential to meeting European Union limits on greenhouse gases.",617,619,Auto Brand,511
1412,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. auto industry's historic growth streak has ended, but demand for new vehicles — especially SUVs — remains healthy as the new year begins. U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent to 17.2 million in 2017, according to Autodata Corp. It was their first year-over-year decline since 2009, ending an unprecedented seven-year expansion. General Motors, Toyota and Ford all reported a 1 percent declines in sales last year compared to 2016. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 8 percent. Honda's sales were flat, while Nissan's rose 2 percent. Volkswagen brand sales rose 5 percent. While sales fell short of 2016's record of 17.55 million, 2017 was still the fourth-best sales year in U.S. history, after 2000, 2015 and 2016, according to Kelley Blue Book. ""It's still a buoyant industry and the underlying factors that drive it are still very positive,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales chief. Analysts think sales will fall a bit further this year. While low unemployment and rising consumer confidence are expected to boost demand, rising interest rates could make it more expensive for people to finance new vehicles. ""That's real money to consumers,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist with Cox Automotive, which owns AutoTrader.com and other car-buying sites. Vehicles also are becoming more durable so consumers can keep them longer, further putting a drag on sales. The average age of vehicles on the road has climbed to 11.6 years, up from 8.8 years in 1998. The growing popularity of leasing will also have a big impact on 2018 sales. Almost one-third of new vehicle sales were leases in 2015, and many of those 4 million lessees will be trading in their vehicles for new ones, according to the car buying site Edmunds.com. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) But leasing also has a downside for automakers, since the influx of late-model used cars returning to the market will cut into sales of new vehicles. Tax cuts also could be a mixed blessing. They will likely stimulate demand, particularly for commercial trucks and vans. But the more the economy grows, the more likely it is that the government will raise interest rates, Chesbrough said. Here are more details of December and 2017 sales: —WINNERS AND LOSERS: Ford's F-Series pickup truck remained the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. in 2017, a title it has now held for 36 years. Ford sold 896,764 F-Series trucks in the U.S. last year, or nearly two trucks every minute, partly because of post-hurricane demand in Texas and Florida. Low gas prices and other factors had buyers ditching cars for SUVs at a fast clip; sales of the Nissan Rogue SUV jumped 22 percent to more than 400,000. But car-heavy brands like Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat all saw their sales drop by double-digit percentages. Toyota Prius hybrid sales plummeted 20.5 percent. — LUXURY CROWN: Mercedes-Benz's sales fell 1 percent to 337,246, but that was still enough to make it the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. for the second straight year. BMW eked out a second-place finish just ahead of Lexus. But some luxury brands struggled. Cadillac and Lexus both saw their sales drop 8 percent last year; Lincoln sales plummeted 17 percent in December. LaNeve said mainstream brands are getting so luxurious that many buyers don't feel the need to step up to a luxury label. — PILING ON THE DEALS: New vehicle prices hit a record last year, averaging $36,113 as buyers bought bigger SUVs and added more safety and infotainment features, Kelley Blue Book said. At the same time, automakers piled on deals in order to juice sales and hang on to their market share. Automakers spent an average of $4,302 per vehicle in incentives last month, passing the previous record set in November, according to the consulting firm J.D. Power. Chevrolet was offering $11,000 off a 2017 Silverado pickup last month. Analysts expect a pullback in incentive spending this year as automakers cut inventory. But there will still be good deals, especially on slow-selling vehicles like midsize sedans. — DECEMBER DIP: No one was expecting U.S. auto sales to top December 2016, which was the best single month in 15 years. Sales dropped 5 percent to 1.6 million last month. Ford's sales were up 1 percent in December as its new large SUVs hit the market, and Hyundai's sales rose 2 percent. But most other automakers saw declines. Fiat Chrysler's sales fell 11 percent , while Toyota's sales dropped 8 percent and Nissan's sales were down 9.5 percent. GM's sales fell 3 percent. Volkswagen's dropped 19 percent.",3092,3094,Auto Brand,573

1458,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators have released models from 14 different automakers that are being recalled to replace potentially deadly Takata air bag inflators. Documents posted Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration include many made by Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Daimler Vans, Toyota, Tesla, BMW, Fiat  Chrysler, Mazda, Subaru, Jaguar-Land Rover, McLaren and Volkswagen. , and released some of their models last week. Earlier this month Takata faulty air bag inflators as it expanded the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. Models released Thursday are equipped with those inflators. The company uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 21 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The U.S. recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years.

1492,"HELSINKI (AP) — Top European Union officials were going into a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday warning they are ready to put tariffs on $20 billion of American goods if he puts duties on car imports. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom will meet Trump in Washington to try to talk him out of imposing the auto tariffs, which would hurt the industry on both sides of the Atlantic and ratchet up trade tensions significantly. ""The aim of this visit is to cool down the situation and prevent an escalation of the trade conflict,"" Malmstrom told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in an interview. But she noted that if the U.S. proceeds with the duties, the EU is ready to respond. It will impose new tariffs on a range of U.S. products, including agricultural and high-tech products and machinery. Trump has repeatedly called the EU - which includes many of the U.S.'s oldest and most committed allies - an unfair trading partner and even labeled it a ""foe."" His administration this year imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, drawing retaliation from the EU on a series of U.S. goods. But those tariffs covered about $3 billion in goods and would pale in comparison with possible 25 percent tariffs on imports of cars, trucks and auto parts. It is unclear what Trump's approach will be in the talks. After tweeting that ""Tariffs are the greatest!"" he suggested hours later in another post that ""both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies!"" The EU's budget chief, Guenther Oettinger, said the EU was prepared to discuss lowering and restructuring all tariffs for all products. ""We want to avoid a further escalation of the trade dispute (into) a trade war,"" Oettinger told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. ""We have good arguments, clear numbers and we have ideas, too."" ""Whether these will help, nobody knows. But not to try, not to fly over there for the meeting, would have been the wrong path."" Auto tariffs would be particularly painful for Germany, where the industry is huge and has long been the symbol of postwar wealth. And it is not just Europeans opposing these tariffs, but American companies as well. The duties would increase the cost of many components that American manufacturers import and use in making cars. Ultimately, that will make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers. EU has a huge stake in the U.S. industry, where European companies produce almost 3 million cars a year, accounting for over a quarter of production in the United States. The biggest exporter of U.S.-made cars is a German company — BMW, through its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. German producers and supplies employ more than 118,000 people at about 300 plants and manufacture more than 800,000 vehicles per year in the U.S. — with more than half of the cars being exported, according to figures provided by the German automotive industry. ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.",2614,2616,Auto Brand,476

1540,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details of the agreement signed Tuesday were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. ""The tariffs may have accelerated their plans for sure, but longer term they need a presence in the largest auto market globally,"" said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne. Tesla has discussed opening a factory in China since at least 2016. ""Still need to see how it gets paid for, which has been a concern,"" Osborne added. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year.

1547,"Most of us know the new-car basic warranty, often referred to as the ""bumper-to-bumper warranty,"" is designed to protect the owner against any factory defects during the first few years of ownership. But did you know this coverage doesn't actually apply to the bumpers? The vehicle's bumpers are considered body panels and so aren't covered. The basic warranty is just one kind of coverage that comes standard on a new car. Here's an overview of new-car warranties and seven things you might not know about them: WARRANTY BASICS A new car comes with a basic or limited warranty, which covers everything except body panels, drivetrain components and wear-and-tear items such as brake pads, oil filters and wiper blades. It also comes with a drivetrain warranty, which covers most of the parts that make the car move, such as the engine, transmission, drive axles and driveshaft. Most carmakers provide roadside assistance. Some also offer free maintenance for a period of time. FINE PRINT ON 10-YEAR POWERTRAIN WARRANTIES Automakers Hyundai, Kia and Mitsubishi tout their decade-long powertrain warranties, and that's great for new-car buyers who plan to hold on to their car for a while. But if you plan on buying one of those cars used, that 10-year warranty doesn't apply to you. You'll only get a five-year, 60,000-mile warranty dating from when the vehicle was first sold. A partial way around this issue is to buy the car as a certified pre-owned vehicle from a dealership. If there was a 10-year powertrain warranty, you'll get the remainder of that term, probably seven or so years. TIRES HAVE A SEPARATE WARRANTY New-car tires are not covered by the vehicle's basic warranty. Instead, the warranty comes from the tiremaker, and it's outlined in a booklet you should find in your new car's glove box. The tire warranty protects against premature tire wear or manufacturing defects. Make sure you keep the tires properly inflated and hold onto receipts from any tire rotations you have done, just in case you need to file a warranty claim and are asked to prove that the tires were properly maintained. WARRANTY COVERAGE CAN CHANGE Warranties and their included benefits are subject to change. If an automaker wants to spur sales, it may offer a longer warranty or other special coverage, such as free maintenance. If the car company's research shows that a certain benefit isn't driving people to dealerships, it can reduce the coverage. Back in 2010, for example, Volvo offered five years of free maintenance. It has now scaled that back to three years. GMC and Chevrolet vehicles once came with a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, but that changed with the 2016 model year. Now the powertrain warranty is good for only 60,000 miles. Warranty changes aren't retroactive, however. Whatever coverage was in force for your car's model year will apply if you need repairs or service covered by the warranty. RANGE OF COVERAGE Starting with the 2018 model year, Volkswagen offers a six-year or 72,000-mile basic warranty. This coverage effectively doubled the warranty from the prior model years and is the longest-lasting among all brands. The shortest basic warranty currently is three years or 36,000 miles, and you'll find it on vehicles from Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota, for example. Makers including Acura, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Fiat, Mercedes-Benz and Mini offer four-year or 50,000-mile basic warranties. A handful, including Genesis, Hyundai, Jaguar and Kia, offer five-year or 60,000-mile basic coverage. ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE Roadside assistance is part of nearly every new-car warranty and lasts as long, if not longer, than the basic warranty. Not so for Toyota, however; its roadside coverage lasts just two years, even though the warranty is for three. EXTRA COVERAGE FOR EV AND HYBRID BATTERIES Batteries are critical to the operation of electric vehicles or hybrid cars and are expensive to replace. A Nissan Leaf battery costs $5,000, for example. Battery components are not part of the basic warranty, but there's good news: Under federal emissions regulations, EV and hybrid batteries must be warrantied for at least eight years or 100,000 miles. This coverage is fully transferable to all subsequent owners. 'GOODWILL' REPAIR Imagine that an expensive part breaks on your vehicle and your warranty has just expired. Normally, you'd have to pay up. But if the dealership service manager approves it, you can get a one-time exemption. This goodwill gesture is entirely at the discretion of your local dealership service department. But if you have a track record of having the maintenance performed there and ask nicely, you'll increase your chances of approval.

1549,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and Chinese governments have been flashing a lot of bravado just before firing the first shots in a conflict that risks erupting into a mutually damaging trade war. ""China will not bow in the face of threats and blackmail, nor will it be shaken in its resolve to defend global free trade,"" a spokesman for Beijing's Commerce Ministry declared Thursday, one day before the two sides were to subject billions of dollars of each other's goods to punishing tariffs. President Donald Trump, who ran for the White House on a vow to force China and other nations to reform their policies, has insisted that a trade war would be easy to win. Yet among the people and business in both countries that are suddenly under threat from higher costs, closed-off markets and deep uncertainties, there's far less confidence. A trade war between the world's two biggest economies will leave casualties — from makers of musical instruments to farmers in America's Midwest to a manufacturer of soldering irons south of Shanghai. In some areas and industries, pain is already being felt. ""There's going to be an awful lot of battles lost on the way,"" said Tim Velde, a fourth-generation farmer in western Minnesota's Yellow Medicine County who is bracing for  China's tariffs on American soybeans. ""I don't see anybody winning."" Tong Feibing, general manager of China's Ningbo Top East Technology Co., which makes soldering irons and had been exporting 30 percent of its output to the United States — before sales plunged in advance of tariffs — is worried. ""There is a chance the company will lose money and might bankrupt,"" Tong warned. ""I will do whatever I can, including layoffs."" At 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Friday, the United States was set to slap tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese products. And Beijing was ready to respond in kind. From there, the hostilities could escalate quickly and drastically. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on up to $450 billion in Chinese imports — nearly 90 percent of all goods China sent the U.S. last year — if Beijing continues to retaliate and doesn't yield to Trump's demands. The Trump administration wants China to drop what it calls its predatory drive to supplant American technological dominance, through tactics that include forcing U.S. companies to reveal trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market and committing cyber-theft. Trade wars can draw blood in several ways. Exporters face taxes on what they ship across the Pacific. This makes their products more expensive and less competitive. And importers must pay more for the foreign machinery and components they buy — and then decide whether they can afford to pass along those higher costs to their customers. In choosing the Chinese goods to tax, the Trump administration tried to limit the impact on American consumers. It aimed instead mainly at industrial products. Yet those tariffs will hurt American companies that rely on Chinese-made components and machinery. Most Americans wouldn't recognize the vast majority of the Chinese imports that the Trump administration is targeting. But they would recognize the companies that use them. PetSmart, for example, says the administration's tariffs will inflate the cost of imported water filters for home aquariums. Jacuzzi has said its hot tubs and bathtubs will be affected by higher U.S. tariffs on pumps. Newell Brands, which owns Rubbermaid, says Americans may face higher costs for its imported FoodSaver vacuum sealer products, which are used to store and preserve food. Moog Music Inc. in Asheville, North Carolina, known for synthesizers used by the likes of David Bowie and Michael Jackson, warns that the tariffs on imported Chinese circuit boards and other parts will ""immediately and drastically"" increase the cost of its instruments and might require layoffs. In a worst-case scenario, Moog said, it might have to move some manufacturing overseas. It's urging employees to call their congressional representatives to protest the tariffs. In southern China, a company that makes LED-lighting is scrambling to find alternatives to the U.S. market, which used to buy 30 percent of its output. The company's salespeople have looked instead for buyers from Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, according to company manager Yang Zhuangnin. He said the company, based near Hong Kong, will try to make improvements to draw American buyers despite higher prices. ""Another method we have been thinking about is to send almost-finished products to another country, and then do the simple production there and re-export to the United States,"" Yang said. ""Clients may have other ways and suggestions. We'll see."" In selecting American products for retaliatory tariffs, Beijing chose many that would inflict political as well as economic pain. Its target list is heavy on American farm exports — a shot at Trump supporters in the nation's heartland. Farmers are also well-represented by lobbyists and powerful members of Congress who might be able to influence the Trump administration. Don Bloss, who grows corn, soybeans, sorghum and what on 3,5000 acres of rolling land in southeastern Nebraska, says the tariff threat has already driven down crop prices. ""Right now,"" Bloss said, ""it's a matter of how much money you're going to lose, not how much money you're going to make."" Automakers could endure pain, too, once China applies higher tariffs to vehicles from the United States. Beijing already imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported autos. Retaliatory tariffs would likely double that tax, said Kristen Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. That could mean trouble for BMW, Mercedes, Tesla and Ford, the largest exporters of vehicles from the U.S. to China. All would likely raise prices, which would slow sales and could force production cuts. A result could be layoffs, Dziczek said, especially at a BMW SUV factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, and a Mercedes SUV plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In addition, the SUVs those plants make include parts from overseas that would be subject to increased U.S. tariffs, further raising prices, she said. Trump's trade team insists that the United States wields a decisive edge over China in a trade war: China sells much more to America ($524 billion last year) than Americans sell China ($188 billion) and so is more vulnerable to tariffs. But trade analysts are skeptical that Beijing will blink first.  The question, said Philip Levy of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, is which side has more political tolerance for pain. ""From China's perspective, this is an unacceptable foreign assault that they will resist at all costs,"" said Levy, who was a trade adviser in President George W. Bush's White House. ""From the perspective of U.S. businesses and farms, this is a self-inflicted wound. That will lead to mounting pressure on members of Congress, which does retain the power to do something about it."" ___ Associated Press Writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis; David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Tom Krisher in Detroit; Christopher Bodeen and Joe McDonald and AP researcher Fu Ting in Beijing contributed to this report.",5699,5701,Auto Brand,581

1576,"MILAN (AP) — Car sales in Europe topped the 15-million mark for the first time in a decade in 2017, the fourth straight year of higher registrations, the association of European carmakers said Wednesday. Registrations of new cars were up 3.4 percent from 14.6 million in 2016, said the association, ACEA. That brings sales to the highest level since before a record-long six-year slump started in 2007. Most major carmakers registered gains, as did four of the top five markets. Only Britain shrank, ceding 6-percent of the market on the heels of the vote to leave the European Union. The southern European nations of Italy and Spain, hardest hit by the six-year crisis, tallied the strongest gains, nearing 8 percent, followed by economic powerhouses France at nearly 5 percent and Germany at nearly 3 percent. Mass-market carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen expanded by 28 percent to over 1.8 million vehicles, thanks to the takeover of Opel from General Motors. Volkswagen remained the No. 1 automaker in the European market, increasing a modest 2.3 percent to 3.5 million vehicles even while the nameplate Volkswagen brand and luxury Audi marquee contracted slightly. Among premium carmakers, Alfa Romeo sales leaped 29 percent to 85,691, the largest increase of any brand, on sales of the Giulia sedan and Stelvio SUV. Daimler's sales grew by 5 percent to 992,528 vehicles while the BMW group trailed the market with a modest 1-percent gain. Toyota sales were up 12 percent, but the Japanese carmaker, which is one of the top-sellers globally, still hasn't hit its one-time goal of 5 percent European market share, falling shy at 4.6 percent. Supercarmaker Lamborghini reported earlier this week that it delivered a record 3,815 cars globally last year, with all markets contributing to an overall 10 percent gain.",1381,1383,Auto Brand,582
1640,"It's true that cars with a manual transmission are a dying breed. According to Edmunds research, manual-equipped vehicles make up less than 3 percent of current U.S. car sales. Automakers are making automatic transmissions standard because the latest ones return better fuel economy, and they shift quicker and smoother than even the best manual transmissions. For some drivers, though, pushing a clutch pedal and rowing your gears are among the most satisfying parts of the driving experience. For others, nostalgia explains the attraction. If you're in either camp, know that some mainstream cars are available with a manual. We've rounded up some of our favorites from a variety of vehicle classes. One of the most appealing sedans on the market is the redesigned 2018 Honda Accord. The Accord boasts a high-quality cabin, generous cargo space, high-tech options and engaging performance. Under the hood is one of two available engines: a 1.5-liter four-cylinder and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both are turbocharged and available with a six-speed manual transmission as a no-cost option on the Sport trim level. Manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for the 2018 Accord Sport with the 1.5-liter engine: $25,780 plus $890 destination With its fair share of style and a likable powertrain, the Mazda 6 is another excellent midsize sedan that offers a manual transmission. You can only get it on the Mazda 6's base Sport and midlevel Touring trims, but even those trim levels provide many desirable features. Other highlights for the Mazda 6 include pleasing power from its four-cylinder engine, a fun-to-drive nature and a classy-looking cabin. A 2018 Mazda 6 is coming this spring that offers similar qualities with updated styling and technology. MSRP for the 2017 Mazda 6 Touring: $24,195 plus $890 destination The new 2018 Jeep Wrangler has been vastly improved with this year's redesign. For now, you can only get the manual with the 3.6-liter V6, but you can put that powertrain package in either the two- or the four-door Wrangler. You can also choose all sorts of options to go along with it. Thanks to high ground clearance, big tires and four-wheel drive, the Wrangler is one of the most capable off-road vehicles on the road today. Yet this new model is also more practical and comfortable than ever before. MSRP for the four-door 2018 Wrangler Unlimited Sport S: $33,695 plus $1,195 destination For a more luxurious experience, there's the 2018 Audi A4. A manual transmission is available in all three of the A4's trim levels:, Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. And it is paired to a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive. As we've come to expect from Audi in recent years, the interior of the A4 has a user-friendly design, comfortable seats and excellent cabin materials. It's a no-brainer if you're looking for an upscale sedan with three pedals. MSRP  for the 2018 A4 Premium: $40,500 plus $975 destination A direct competitor of the A4 is the perennial luxury sedan powerhouse known as the BMW 3 Series. Unlike the Audi, which comes with only all-wheel drive when you opt for a manual, the BMW offers a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive as well as four-cylinder or six-cylinder power to go with the manual transmission. From the stylish exterior to the impeccable interior build quality and the modern tech, there's a lot to like about the 3 Series sedan. MSRP for the 2018 BMW 340i xDrive sedan: $50,950 plus $995 destination HONORABLE MENTIONS Many budget-oriented vehicles offer a manual transmission. Worth checking out are Honda's Civic and HR-V crossover SUV, Kia's Soul hatchback and Toyota's Corolla iM hatchback. Of course, there are many high-performance vehicles that you can get today with a stick shift. In the compact category, check out the Ford Focus ST or RS, the Honda Civic Type R, the Mazda MX-5 Miata, the Mini Cooper Hardtop, the Subaru WRX and the Volkswagen Golf GTI. Detroit's muscle cars are keeping up tradition, too: The Chevrolet Camaro, the Dodge Challenger and the Ford Mustang all still have manuals. Don't bother with Ferrari, though. Nothing coming from Maranello, Italy, has a clutch pedal anymore. EDMUNDS SAYS: If you're looking for a car with a manual transmission, you don't have to look far. Sedans, SUVs, luxury cars, small hatchbacks and sports cars all have something to offer in the manual-transmission category. Just try not to stall yours when you pull away from the dealer lot. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

1653,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is getting rid of three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next 3½ years. The company says it's sinking $175 million into a Lansing, Michigan, factory to make replacements for the ATS compact, CTS midsize and XTS full-size cars. Automakers are starting to dump sedan models in the U.S. as buyers continue to flock to SUVs and trucks. Fiat Chrysler cut U.S.-made compact and midsize cars in 2016, while Ford announced earlier this year that it would stop selling all cars but the Mustang over the next several years. This year trucks and SUVs accounted for more than two thirds of U.S. auto sales, with cars at about one third. Just five years ago it was about half for each. The ATS won't be replaced but Cadillac hopes to cover its market with the new vehicles. The ATS was designed to compete with the BMW 3 Series but never really caught on. The XTS was based on a Chevrolet Impala but also never sold well. It also overlapped with Cadillac's CT6 flagship large sedan. Last year ATS sales fell 39 percent, while CTS sales dropped 35 percent and XTS sales were off 27 percent. The ATS recovered a bit this year but is still far behind competitors. Spokesman Donny Nordlicht would say only that the new cars will debut by the end of 2021, and that further details would be released later. The changes will not change the Lansing Grand River factory's workforce of about 2,000 people. The Cadillac brand is emphasizing SUVs to match market demand, according to GM.

They include vacuum cleaners, furniture and car and bicycle parts, but not U.S.-branded smartphones and laptops. It is scheduled to make a decision on the potential tariffs after Aug. 31. Energy and industrial companies and basic materials makers are taking some of the worst losses, along with chip makers, which make large portions of their sales in China.

PRODUCER PRICES US wholesale prices shoot up 3.4 percent over past year WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. wholesale prices increased 0.3 percent in June, a slight slowing from May. But the 12-month gain was the fastest in more than six years, adding to evidence that inflation is beginning to rise after years of weak price gains. The Labor Department says the June increase in its producer price index — which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer — followed a more rapid 0.5 percent rise in May. The deceleration reflected a big drop in food costs in June and a much smaller increase in energy prices. Wholesale prices over the past 12 months have risen 3.4 percent. It is the largest 12-month gain since a 3.7 percent rise in the 12 months ending in November 2011. TARIFFS-SENATE Senate voices protest over Trump's aluminum, steel tariffs WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers have finally acted on their frustration with the Trump administration's growing use of tariffs. The Senate has passed a modest, nonbinding resolution designed to give Congress more say about trade penalties imposed in the name of national security. The resolution has passed by an 88-11 vote. It directs a congressional committee that's reconciling separate spending bills to include language giving Congress a role when such tariffs are put in place. Negotiators are free to ignore the Senate's guidance. Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who pushed the tariff language, acknowledges the effort is ""a baby step."" Some senators are portraying it as a rebuke of President Donald Trump's use of a national security waiver to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. US-CHINA TARIFFS US says WTO must do more on China trade policies BEIJING (AP) — The U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization is calling for the global trade body to update its rules to deal with complaints about Chinese industrial policies that he said harm other countries. Dennis Shea has accused China of causing ""serious harm"" to WTO partners by failing to live up to free-trade principles. He said that ""must be addressed"" by the trade body or others. ""This reckoning can no longer be put off,"" he said according to prepared remarks in a closed-door session. He spoke Wednesday at China's turn for a regular WTO review of countries' trade policies. The U.S., Europe and others want the WTO to overhaul its rules to take account of industrial policy, state-owned industry and other issues over which Beijing has sparred with its trading partners. CHINA-AUTO SALES China auto sales growth weakens in June amid trade battle BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales decelerated in June, adding to economic worries for Beijing amid a worsening trade battle with Washington. An industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said Wednesday sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans rose 2.3 percent in the most populous auto market, down from May's 7.9 percent. Weakness in auto sales comes as China's economic growth cools after the government tightened controls on bank lending to curb surging debt.

(AP) — BMW says it still plans to add 1,000 workers in South Carolina, even as the company starts production of a new vehicle in China. Spokesman Ken Sparks told the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg that BMW's new electric iX3 SUV will be produced only in China, and that effort won't affect production of the new X7 model in South Carolina. But BMW's U.S. manufacturing remains vulnerable to a trade war. China imposed another 25 percent charge on imports from the U.S., prompting BMW this week to announce higher Chinese sticker prices. The South Carolina plant exports more than two thirds of the 400,000 vehicles it has produced annually, mostly to China. Small Business Chamber President Frank Knapp says BMW's suppliers need more details, so they can know how many people to employ. FOX-SKY Murdoch's 21st Century Fox ups Sky bid in Comcast battle LONDON (AP) — Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has increased its bid to take full control of Sky in its prolonged battle with Comcast for the lucrative pay TV service.

The company says this is 12 percent higher than the last bid from U.S.-based Comcast. The new bid values Sky at 24.5 billion pounds ($32.5 billion). Fox has increased its bid by just over 30 percent since its first offer in December 2016. Murdoch's company still faces significant regulatory battles in Britain, including the culture secretary's statement that Fox would have to divest itself of Sky News to win government approval because of concerns about media plurality.

So companies are scrambling to adjust their supply chains to keep U.S.-bound goods from passing through China. The Trump administration's tariff hike on medical equipment, electronics and other goods from China apply to exports made by U.S. or European companies as well as by Chinese suppliers. At the same time, BMW Group and the biggest Chinese SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, have announced a partnership to produce electric MINI vehicles in China. It's a sign that global automakers are increasing development under pressure from Beijing. BMW and Great Wall said their venture will also make electrics for the Chinese partner's brand. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology. ___ WHAT'S NEXT President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. is ready to target an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports — and then $300 billion more — if Beijing refuses to yield to U.S. demands and continues to retaliate. If his administration went ahead with that threat, it would raise the total of targeted Chinese goods to potentially $550 billion — more than the $506 billion that China actually shipped to the United States last year. Even if the Trump administration doesn't follow through on that threat, more individuals could be affected over time by the tariffs that kicked in last week. Some American companies that rely on Chinese-made machinery or parts, for example, will eventually have to pass along at least some of their higher costs to customers. Others will likely decide to hold back on hiring. ___ THE BACKDROP Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of goods in response to complaints that Beijing is hurting American companies by stealing or pressuring enterprises to hand over technology. The U.S. trade war with China is the most consequential trade conflict the Trump administration has provoked. But it's hardly the only one. It has also applied tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The 28-country EU bloc has responded with import taxes on $3.25 billion of U.S. goods. In the meantime, the Trump administration has threatened to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump has also spoken about slapping tariffs on imported cars, trucks and auto parts, which General Motors has warned could hurt the U.S. auto industry and drive up car prices.",598,600,Auto Brand,587
1670,"BRUSSELS (AP) — One of the European Union's main leaders will sit down with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday hoping to convince him to hold off from raising tariffs on imported cars and avoid a trans-Atlantic trade war. The visit to the White House by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker comes on the heels of an especially ill-tempered continental tour by Trump, in which he called the EU — a 28-country bloc including many historic U.S. allies — his ""foe."" Trump especially came down hard on Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany, the EU's economic powerhouse. Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe, and the EU has responded in kind. But even that exchange of measures would pale in comparison with duties on cars — a huge industry that has long been the symbol of postwar wealth on both sides of the Atlantic, and especially in Germany. Trump badly wants to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with the EU and is accusing the bloc of not playing fair on trade. And when it comes to security, he says the Europeans are refusing to pay their share in NATO and instead live off the massive U.S. defense budget. As Juncker was flying over, Trump set the tone with a tweet: ""Tariffs are the greatest!"" he wrote. ""Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It's as simple as that."" Germany has become increasingly fed up with such outbursts. Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, told ARD television hours before Trump's tweet that, ""We won't let ourselves be threatened and just cave in because, if we do that once, I fear that we will have to deal with such behavior very often in the future."" When Juncker, the doyen of compromise and consensus politics in the EU, walks into Trump's office, the hope is that the mood will be different. ""This is an occasion to de-dramatize any potential tensions around trade and to engage in an open, constructive dialogue,"" said Juncker's spokesman, Margaritis Schinas. The stakes are high, as the car industry carries huge heft in terms of trade and jobs in both the EU and U.S. The European car federation says that the United States is the No. 1 destination for EU-built cars, amounting to almost 30 percent of the total EU export value. It accounts for a quarter of U.S. car imports. If Trump imposes a 25 percent tariff on imports of cars, trucks and auto parts, it ""risks dragging us all down to a game of tit for tat retaliations that ultimately leave consumers in the U.S. as well as in Europe worse off,"" said Professor Alexander Mattelaer of the Egmont Institute think tank. The EU has already told its U.S. counterparts it is preparing a list of countermeasures if the car tariffs are imposed. EU passenger car exports to the U.S. amount to $44 billion a year, dwarfing the tariff tiff on steel and aluminum, which resulted in EU countermeasures of $3.2 billion. Not only is the EU firmly against the tariffs, but so is the U.S. car industry and many voices in Congress. Automakers, suppliers and dealers argue that the tariffs would drive up car prices for U.S. consumers and hurt auto companies by increasing the cost of imported components and invite retaliation from U.S. trading partners. On top of that, the EU also has a huge stake in the U.S. industry, where European companies produce almost 3 million cars a year, accounting for over a quarter of production in the United States. The biggest exporter of U.S.-made cars is a German company — BMW, through its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. German producers and supplies employ more than 118,000 people at about 300 plants, and manufacture more than 800,000 vehicles per year in the U.S. — with more than half of the cars being exported, said the German Association of the Automotive Industry. Tariffs on the industry could change all that. ""Open markets are of decisive significance for our involvement in the U.S,"" said the German federation's president, Bernard Mattes. Usually, such economic considerations alone would push the sides reach a compromise. But that's not necessarily the case now. Juncker is not bringing any blockbuster offers to Washington, according to a senior European official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Instead, Juncker intends to get a better understanding of what the Trump administration really wants. He will also discuss the possibility of trade talks between major auto-exporting countries and of an EU-U.S. free-trade agreement that would reduce trade barriers on industrial products, including autos. Whatever compromise they are looking for, ""the Trump administration doesn't want mutual concessions,"" said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It wants unilateral concessions"" from the EU. ___ Paul Wiseman in Washington and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",3534,3536,Auto Brand,588

FEDERAL RESERVE-POWELL Fed expects economic gains to prompt gradual rate hikes WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve says it expects that the ongoing strength of the U.S. economy will warrant further gradual increases in interest rates this year, delivering the same steady-as-it-goes message under new leader Jerome Powell as it had provided under Janet Yellen. The Fed's projection on rate hikes came with the release Friday of its semi-annual monetary report to Congress. Powell will testify on the report before the House Financial Services Committee next Tuesday, making his first public appearance since taking over as chairman earlier this month. The report stated that the Fed expects steady economic gains will warrant ""further gradual increases"" in the Fed's benchmark rate. But it said the rate was likely to remain low enough to stimulate the economy over the next two years. UNITED STATES-NORTH KOREA Trump to announce new NKorea sanctions WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is hitting more than 50 vessels, shipping companies and trade businesses with sanctions in the latest bid to turn up the pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program. The administration billed it as the largest installment of North Korean economic restrictions to date. President Donald Trump went further, declaring in a speech Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference that it was ""the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before."" While the number of companies from North Korea and other nations was high, the economic impact is unclear. It was certain to be less than previous U.S. measures that targeted large banks and business networks in China and Russia that deal with the North. However, it significantly tightens the noose on North Korean trading. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that the U.S. has now imposed more than 450 sanctions against the North, about half of them in the last year — including ""virtually all their ships that they're using at this moment in time.""

Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby couldn't confirm the new estimate but said Dominion's financial disclosure next week would have more information.

Promoting the constitutional protections for states' rights — outlined in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — has always been popular among politicians. But it also is situational.

45,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is gearing up to lead a buyout of the electric car maker in a stunning move that would end the maverick company's eight-year history trading on the stock market. In his typically unorthodox fashion, the eccentric Musk dropped his bombshell on his Twitter account, which he has used as a platform for pranks, vitriol and now for a proposal to pull off one of the biggest buyouts in U.S. history. Musk got the ball rolling Tuesday after the stock market had already been open more than three hours with a announcing he had secured funding to buy all of Tesla's stock at $420 per share with no further details. At that price, the buyout would cost nearly $72 billion, based on Tesla's outstanding stock as of July 27, but it's unlikely the deal would cost that much because Musk owns a roughly 20 percent stake in the Palo Alto, California, company. He also said he intends to give Tesla's existing shareholders the option of retaining a stake in the company through a special fund, if they want. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk wrote in his first tweet, following up with ""good morning"" and a smiley emoji. He later that the only uncertainty about completing the deal is whether he can gain shareholder approval. The first tweet came hours after the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had built a significant stake in Tesla Inc., but it was unclear if that was the funding Musk was referring to. The Financial Times, citing unnamed people with direct knowledge of the matter said Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund had built a stake of between 3 and 5 percent of Telsa's shares. Musk's announcement was initially met with widespread skepticism, with many people connecting the proposed price to 420 being a common slang term for marijuana. Musk also previously used his Twitter account to joke that Tesla was going bankrupt in an April Fool's Day and his stability was called into question last month after he called a British diver who helped rescue children from a Thailand cave a pedophile. That baseless tweet was quickly deleted and Musk apologized to the diver. The confusion caused by Musk's Tuesday announcement via Twitter also prompted regulators of the Nasdaq stock market to temporarily suspend trading in Tesla's stock. Although it's unusual for a CEO to make such a major announcement over social media, it does not appear to be improper. ""It's very unusual for any CEO other than Elon Musk. This is not how you do it and it makes you wonder how seriously to take it,"" said Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan. Musk probably wasn't violating any regulations by simply announcing that he was considering taking the company private, Gordon said, but his assertion that the funding already has been locked up could ""expose him to at least potential legal risk"" if it turns out that the financing is on shaky footing. Musk later brought some clarity to the situation in an email to Tesla employees that was on Tesla's blog. Trading in Tesla's stock resumed shortly after the letter's release, and the stock climbed 11 percent to close at $379.57. Musk's offer is 9 percent higher than Tesla's peak closing price of $385 reached nearly a year ago. By taking Tesla private, Musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring from one quarter to the next. Making money has proven elusive for Tesla while it has been investing in electric car technology and ramping up production of its vehicles, including a sedan with a starting price of $35,000 to appeal to a broader audience. The company has only posted a quarterly profit twice in its history and has never made money during an entire calendar year, something that Musk has been trying to change by cutting costs, including recent mass layoffs that trimmed Tesla's workforce by 9 percent. Tesla lost another $717.5 million in its most recent quarter. Musk ""has been running Tesla like a private company with publicly traded stock anyway so this deal makes some sense,"" Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey said. Tesla completed an initial public offering of stock in 2010, largely because Wall Street provided a convenient vehicle to raise billions of dollars to finance its expansion. By going private, Tesla will lose that convenient source of financing, something that could cause massive headaches if the company continues to burn through cash as much as it has in recent years, Ramsey said. Despite its challenges, Tesla has remained a favorite among many investors, partly because of their faith in Musk, who made his initial fortune as a co-founder of PayPal and also is the CEO of a trail-blazing aerospace company, SpaceX, that's already private. But another substantial segment of investors are convinced Tesla is doomed to fail and are betting on the company's eventual demise by becoming ""short sellers"" of its stock. Short sellers borrow shares from other investors and then immediately sell them on the premise that they will be able to buy them back at a lower price later to replace they stock they borrowed. Musk has long raged against short sellers and mentioned his desire to be rid of them as one of his reasons for taking Tesla private. ""Being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company,"" he wrote. If Musk decides against going private, Gordon said his credibility could take another hit, though one he could weather. ""If he doesn't go forward with it, it will end up be another Elon Musk big mouth faux pas,"" Gordon said. ""He will live to see another day. People will shake their heads and say, 'that's Elon.'"" ____ Alexandra Olson reported from New York.",21,25,Auto Brand,596
53,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. is laying off about 3,600 white-collar workers as it slashes costs in an effort to become profitable.

The move will not affect factory workers as Tesla continues to ramp up production of its lower-priced Model 3 compact car. Musk says the company is motivated by turning a profit. The company has not posted an annual profit in its 15 years of business. Musk says Tesla is making the move now so it never has to do it again.

JOB OPENINGS US job openings slip in May, as quits reach 17-year high WASHINGTON (AP) — Businesses advertised fewer jobs in May than the previous month, but the tally of open positions outnumbered the ranks of the unemployed for only the second time in the past two decades. The Labor Department also says the proportion of workers quitting their jobs reached the highest level since April 2001. Quits are seen as a positive sign that workers are confident they can find another job. Most people who quit do so for higher-paying positions. The figures reflect a strong job market driven by optimistic employers seeking to expand their workforces. Last week's jobs report showed that businesses hired workers at a healthy pace and the unemployment rate remained very low, at 4 percent. There were 6.64 million available jobs in May, but just 6 million unemployed people.

It said Corning was among the companies that would be affected by the higher duties. TRUMP-CLIMATE PLAN Trump replacement for Obama climate plan moves forward BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Trump administration is advancing its plan to replace the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts against global warming with a new rule expected to be friendlier to the coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency said it sent the new rule to the White House for review on Monday. The document itself was not released. The move coincided with former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler's first day at the helm of the EPA following last week's resignation of Administrator Scott Pruitt. Obama sought to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, largely by reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants. Under Trump, the EPA declared the old rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. CHINA-TESLA Tesla announces deal for Shanghai factory UNDATED (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla says it will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai. Tesla says an agreement signed Tuesday with a Shanghai city government agency calls for construction to start in the near future. It says production would begin three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. The announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese trade tensions and follows Beijing's decision in April to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through joint ventures with local partners. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market. Automakers are investing heavily to develop models to appeal to local customers. CHINA-BMW-ELECTRIC MINI BMW to make electric MINIs in China with Great Wall Motor BEIJING (AP) — BMW Group and China's biggest SUV brand, Great Wall Motor, have announced a partnership to produce electric MINI vehicles in China. Tuesday's announcement comes as automakers pour billions of dollars into creating electric models for China, the biggest market for the technology, under pressure from Beijing to accelerate development. BMW and Great Wall said the venture also will produce electric vehicles under the Chinese partner's brand. Other automakers including General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. have announced similar plans with local partners to produce dozens of electric models for China.

If it succeeds, Israel will become the fourth country to land on the moon, after the U.S., the Soviet Union and China. The $95 million project, largely funded by South African-Israeli billionaire Morris Kahn and other donors, aims to land on the moon on Feb. 13. Kahn said if they pull off the moonshot it would be ""a tremendous achievement."" SpaceIL originally vied for Google's Lunar Xprize, but the $20 million competition was scrapped in March after none of the companies met the deadline. CUBA-PRIVATE-BUSINESS Cuba unfreezing growth of private tourism businesses HAVANA (AP) — The Cuban government will allow new restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and transportation businesses by the end of the year, reopening the most vibrant sectors of the private economy after freezing growth for more than a year. The government is unveiling a set of new regulations meant to control the growth of tourism-related private businesses and collect more tax revenue from them. Private restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts boomed after U.S.-Cuba normalization in 2014 prompted rapid growth in tourism to Cuba. Tax evasion and purchase of stolen state materials also boomed in the mostly cash-based private hospitality sector. Among other measures, the new regulations announced Tuesday require private businesses to move all their revenue through state-run bank accounts. Cuba froze new licenses for restaurants, bed-and-breakfasts and other key business in August 2017.

They will be replaced by pretzels and, on some longer flights, other free snacks. Southwest says the decision follows months of deliberation and isn't tied to any particular incident involving passengers with allergies. No snack is more closely identified with a U.S. airline. Over the years, Southwest used the humble legume in marketing campaigns. A blog on its website is called Nuts About Southwest.

98,"You've heard of Tesla Autopilot, but perhaps not always in a good way: The semi-autonomous driving system is now under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board for the role it may have played in a March fatal accident near Mountain View, California. But you might not have heard about Cadillac Super Cruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist, two other semi-autonomous driving systems that are available in new cars today. The Tesla, Cadillac and Nissan systems are not exactly the same. And despite a common perception of such technology, none of them allow the car to drive itself. But these systems can reduce driver fatigue on long trips or ease the tedium of slow-and-go freeway traffic. For new-car shoppers, it's important to know what these systems can — and can't — handle. HOW THEY WORK Semi-autonomous driving systems essentially combine two existing technologies — traffic-adaptive cruise control and a lane-keeping system — into a more cohesive whole. The cruise control automatically handles the acceleration and braking, while the lane-keeping system makes steering inputs that center the car within its lane. The adaptive cruise feature can be used by itself in these systems if the driver so desires. Whether or not the self-steering component of these systems is enabled, it's imperative that the driver remain vigilant and attentive at all times. TESLA AUTOPILOT Autopilot is the most well-known semi-autonomous system. It uses cameras and sensors on the front, sides and rear of the car to observe lane markings and to ""see"" other cars that are nearby. It's simple to engage, requiring only two quick taps of a stalk. There are no limitations on where Autopilot can be used. Drivers can enable it on the freeway, side streets, or anywhere with distinct lane markings. This freedom has a downside, though: Side streets are never as consistently well-marked as freeways, and the system cannot respond to traffic signals or stop signs. Autopilot allows for only about 30 seconds of hands-free driving before sounding a reminder to place your hands on the wheel. If you don't comply, Autopilot is disabled for the remainder of the drive. Notably, Tesla can update the Autopilot software over the air, not necessitating a trip to a service center. As a result, Tesla can quickly send out improvements to Autopilot's functionality or resolve problems with it, such as one Edmunds experienced during a February test drive in our Model 3. During the drive, Autopilot steered the car across the double yellow line into oncoming traffic, requiring the driver's intervention to bring it back into its lane. The problem did not reoccur after a software update. Tesla offers Autopilot on its Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles. CADILLAC SUPER CRUISE Cadillac's new Super Cruise system allows complete hands-free driving with no time or distance limit provided the driver meets certain criteria. Like Autopilot, Super Cruise employs a suite of external sensors and cameras. Then it adds a subsystem in the cabin that makes sure you're paying attention: an infrared camera mounted atop the steering column that tracks the driver's eye and head movement. If your focus is not on the road ahead and you make no attempt to take the wheel, the system sounds several warnings of increasing urgency until eventually canceling Super Cruise and slowing the car to a gentle halt. No other semi-autonomous driving system available today has such a sophisticated driver-monitoring system. Super Cruise is somewhat more cumbersome to activate compared to Autopilot and drivers can only use it on certain limited-access freeways that have been approved by engineers from General Motors, which owns Cadillac. GM updates the database of Super Cruise-compatible freeways regularly. For now, Super Cruise is available only on the Cadillac CT6 sedan. It's safe to assume it will be deployed on other GM vehicles, but the company hasn't announced any so far. NISSAN PROPILOT ASSIST Nissan's new ProPilot Assist system also is best on freeways with gentle turns and well-marked lanes on both sides. That's the environment Nissan recommends. While drivers can use the system on side streets, it's not well-suited to those roads. Some curves are too tight for the system to handle at the speed limit, and it will cancel its operation and readily return control to the driver in those situations. Like Autopilot, ProPilot Assist requires the driver's hands to be on the wheel at all times. On the whole, Nissan's system isn't quite at the level of capability of those by Tesla or Cadillac. Rather than referencing map data on board as the Tesla and Cadillac systems do, ProPilot Assist reacts to its environment in real time. For 2018, Nissan offers ProPilot Assist on its Rogue and Leaf vehicles, with more promised in the future. EDMUNDS SAYS:  While semi-autonomous systems do not make cars self-driving, they can reduce the stress of driving and are worthwhile features for new-car shoppers to consider. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

The infraction will cost the social media site $663,000. Officials also say Facebook should reveal the results of its internal investigations to British officials and others who are investigating the scandal.

122,"DETROIT (AP) — At the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains sits a sprawling factory that has become an unlikely victim in the escalating trade fight between the U.S. and China. The plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina, is owned by German automaker BMW, and it exports more vehicles to China than any other auto factory in America. The 6 million-square-foot plant makes luxury sport utility vehicles, which are coveted by affluent Chinese buyers for their German prestige and reliability that's better than Chinese domestic brands. One in every four SUVs that comes off its assembly lines is shipped to China. Now those 87,000 vehicles could be subject to extra tariffs that could add tens of thousands of Chinese yuan to their already lofty prices. The trade dispute between the U.S. and China intensified last week, when the Trump administration released its list of imports from China worth $50 billion on which it would impose 25-percent tariffs as punishment for China's alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property. China retaliated with its own threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. products, including autos. In a move aimed at defusing the conflict, China President Xi Jinping on Tuesday indicated his country would make concessions, promising to cut auto import taxes and improve intellectual property protection but offering no specifics. China has promised similar changes in the past but has not followed through. If both sides make good on tariff threats, German luxury automakers, rather than American companies, will be hit the hardest. American and Japanese automakers produce most of what they sell in China at factories located there. In addition to BMW's South Carolina factory, a Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, ships as many as 75,000 pricey GLS and GLE SUVs to China. Because the German vehicles — with leather seats, heated steering wheels, sunroofs and other goodies — command high prices in China, the current 25 percent tariff on autos shipped in from the U.S. doesn't seem that outrageous. However, if the tariff doubles to 50 percent of the manufacturing cost as China has threatened, the German vehicles could be priced out of the market, forcing the companies to make them in China or elsewhere. A BMW X5 large SUV, for example, starts at $57,200 in the U.S. The cost to manufacture a high-priced SUV is roughly 30 percent below the sticker price. At 25 percent, the tariff would be about $10,000 (63,020 yuan) on an X5 entering China. It would double to $20,000 (126,040 yuan) if the tariff doubles. The U.S. isn't as restrictive about cars coming into the country. Currently, there is a 2.5 percent tariff on imported autos and 25 percent on imported pickup trucks. Trump is proposing to hit all auto imports with a 25 percent tariff. In addition, Trump last week threatened to add $100 billion more in tariffs if China retaliates against the U.S. It's not clear yet what products that would cover. Realizing what's at stake, BMW put out a statement supporting free trade and warning that a conflict could hurt its factory, which exported 70 percent of the 371,000 SUVs it made last year to 123 countries. One third of the exports went to China. ""Free trade has made the success story of BMW Group in the U.S. possible,"" wrote Kenn Sparks, the company's chief U.S. spokesman. ""In our opinion, a further escalation of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China would be harmful for all stakeholders."" The plant started off making cars when it opened more than 23 years ago at a time when the SUV was starting to catch on in the U.S. BMW quickly spotted the trend and began building one SUV there. It shifted the whole plant to sport utilities by 2008 as Americans and then much of the world began falling for the high seating and roomy cargo area. When it opened in 1994 with an initial investment of $600 million, the plant had 2,000 workers, helping South Carolina diversify its employment from textiles to manufacturing. It now makes X3, X4, X5 and X6 SUVs there, growing into an economic powerhouse as BMW hired a total of 10,000 people and invested $8 billion. The factory also supports 40 parts supply companies in the state. One study found that the plant spurred more than 30,000 jobs in the state. But Kristen Dziczek, a vice president at industry think tank Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says a trade war with China could force BMW, Mercedes and others to rethink where they make vehicles, and that could cost jobs in the heart of Trump country. Spartanburg County, where the BMW plant is located, voted 63 percent for Trump in 2016. BMW wouldn't comment on jobs. Before the tariffs were floated, it had plans to start producing the X3 compact SUV at a Chinese factory. Even so, Sparks says the Spartanburg plant will make more X3s than it does now because of high demand in the U.S. Other auto producers that could suffer because of the tariffs threatened by China include Tesla, which a Barclay's analyst said gets about 12 percent of its revenue by exporting about 14,300 electric cars and SUVs from California to China. Ford also ships more than 50,000 vehicles, mostly from the luxury Lincoln brand, to China. But most of what it sells in China is made there in joint venture factories. Ironically, the 25 percent tariff that the U.S. is contemplating against China could cost some U.S. automakers money. General Motors exports about 37,000 Buick Envision SUVs from China to the U.S. They would be subject to a higher tariff, adding thousands to the vehicle's $34,000 sticker price. Ford plans to export what could be thousands of its Focus compact cars from China to the U.S. starting in 2019. At present, the U.S. is besting China in the auto export business. Companies shipped about 250,000 vehicles from the U.S. to China last year, and China sent about 25,000 to the U.S.  But Dziczek says that is rapidly changing with more production headed to China.",4964,4968,Auto Brand,604
124,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful even within the traditional confines of a State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump inflated the impact of his tax cuts Tuesday night, declared an end to a ""war"" on energy that did not exist when he took office and displayed a faulty grasp of immigration policy. A look at some of the statements in his speech and how they compare with the facts: TRUMP: ""We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history."" THE FACTS: No truer now than in the countless other times he has said the same. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ TRUMP: ""After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" THE FACTS: Actually, they are not rising any faster than they have before. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in 2017, slightly slower than the 2.9 percent increase recorded in 2016 under President Barack Obama. Most economists say that wages should increase at a faster rate as the unemployment rate drops. The unemployment rate stands at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that has done little so far to spark rising wages. The last time unemployment was this low, in the late 1990s, average hourly pay was rising at a 4 percent pace. ____ TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: That's a highly misleading characterization. The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the last five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Barack Obama's, making accusations of a war on energy hard to sustain. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that: The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the last decade. ___ TRUMP: ""We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money."" THE FACTS: Few economists think average incomes will jump by $4,000 simply because companies are paying less in taxes. The figure cited by Trump comes from his chief economist, Kevin Hassett. Many mainstream economists poked wide holes into this claim, including the author of one of the research papers cited by Hassett. Economists generally say most of the savings from lower corporate taxes would flow to investors, rather than workers. The problem with the $4,000 claim is that Trump is essentially promising $500 billion in income gains across the entire economy from tax cuts that are a small fraction of that total on an annual basis. ___ TRUMP: ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker."" THE FACTS: This appears to be true, but may not be as impressive as it sounds. According to a tally of public announcements by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that supported the tax law, about 3 million workers have gotten bonuses, raises or larger payments to their retirement accounts since the tax law was signed. That's about 2 percent of the more than 154 million Americans with jobs. The Labor Department said before the tax package was signed into law that 38 percent of workers would probably get some form of bonus in 2017. Few companies have yet granted across-the-board pay raises, which Trump and GOP leaders promised would result from the cut in corporate tax rates included in the overhaul. Many, such as Walmart and BB&T Bank, said they will raise their minimum wages. Walmart made similar announcements in 2015 and 2016. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. It's a far cry from what Trump and the GOP-led Congress set out to do last year, which was to scrap most of the sweeping Obama-era health law and replace it with a Republican alternative. The GOP blueprint would have left millions more Americans uninsured, making it even more unpopular than ""Obamacare.""

129,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump struck a variety of false notes in his big speech to Congress this past week and followed up with a curious coda — a plain-as-your-face exaggeration about the TV audience that tuned in for it. A look at some of Trump's recent statements, from his State of the Union address and beyond: TRUMP: ""Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history."" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Not the highest in history. Trump's TV viewership as measured by Nielsen (45.6 million, as he said) trailed that for first State of the Union speeches by Barack Obama (48 million), George W. Bush (51.7 million) and Bill Clinton (46.8 million). Trump also got more TV viewers in his first speech to Congress a year ago (47.7 million) than in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. There is no reliable measure for how many people watched Tuesday on their computers or phones, a slice of viewership that is not counted by Nielsen. But Trump was not factoring in those viewers in his false claim. He cited the Nielsen number only. ___ TRUMP: ""We've signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."" — remarks Thursday to Republican lawmakers' retreat. THE FACTS: No. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. He made the same claim Tuesday night and countless times before that. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, Trump's plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the past five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: What war? Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Obama's. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that. The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under George W. Bush and Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the past decade. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades.""

Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, but that takes effect next year. ___ TRUMP: ""We have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons."" THE FACTS: That's an exaggeration and goes beyond how even Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the administration's most aggressive anti-gang enforcer, characterizes the scope of the effort. Sessions said in speeches this past week that federal authorities had secured the convictions of nearly 500 human traffickers and 1,200 gang members, ""and worked with our international allies to arrest or charge more than 4,000 MS-13 members."" On other occasions, the attorney general has specifically said the 4,000 number reflects work done with ""our partners in Central America."" That suggests that at least some of the MS-13 members Trump is referring to weren't actually in the U.S when they were arrested, and aren't now in U.S. prisons. ___ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on beautiful clean coal."" THE FACTS: Coal is not clean. According to the Energy Department, more than 83 percent of all major air pollutants — sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, toxic mercury and dangerous soot particles — from power plants are from coal, even though coal makes up only 43 percent of the power generation. Power plants are the No. 1 source of those pollutants. Coal produces nearly twice as much heat-trapping carbon dioxide per energy created as natural gas, the department says. In 2011, coal burning emitted more than 6 million tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides versus 430,000 tons from other energy sources combined. ___ Associated Press writers Hope Yen, Josh Boak, Matthew Daly, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Eric Tucker, Seth Borenstein and Elliot Spagat contributed to this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck EDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures",5210,5214,Auto Brand,606
133,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai under an agreement signed Tuesday, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that suggested the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production.",37,41,Auto Brand,607
147,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful even within the traditional confines of a State of the Union speech, President Donald Trump inflated the impact of his tax cuts Tuesday night, declared an end to a ""war"" on energy that did not exist when he took office and displayed a faulty grasp of immigration policy. A look at some of the statements in his speech and how they compare with the facts: TRUMP: ""We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.""

Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ TRUMP: ""After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" THE FACTS: Actually, they are not rising any faster than they have before. Average hourly pay rose 2.5 percent in 2017, slightly slower than the 2.9 percent increase recorded in 2016 under President Barack Obama. Most economists say that wages should increase at a faster rate as the unemployment rate drops. The unemployment rate stands at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but that has done little so far to spark rising wages. The last time unemployment was this low, in the late 1990s, average hourly pay was rising at a 4 percent pace. ____ TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: That's a highly misleading characterization. The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa.

These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money."" THE FACTS: Few economists think average incomes will jump by $4,000 simply because companies are paying less in taxes. The figure cited by Trump comes from his chief economist, Kevin Hassett. Many mainstream economists poked wide holes into this claim, including the author of one of the research papers cited by Hassett. Economists generally say most of the savings from lower corporate taxes would flow to investors, rather than workers. The problem with the $4,000 claim is that Trump is essentially promising $500 billion in income gains across the entire economy from tax cuts that are a small fraction of that total on an annual basis. ___ TRUMP: ""Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker.""

At first the magazine declined to give the Tesla Model three its ""Recommended Buy"" rating because it felt it lacked the ability to come to a stop quickly. It pegged the stopping distance for the Model S from 60 to 0 at 152 feet. But  a wireless update of antilock braking software improved the stopping distance by some 19 feet. That bumped the vehicle's overall score enough for Consumer Reports to give the car its ""Recommended Buy"" rating. The Model 3 is Tesla's first attempt to appeal to mass-market buyers.

Netflix soared 8 percent after reporting huge subscriber gains. Amazon rose 2.6 percent. Technology, industrial and health care stocks also rose. UnitedHealth added 3.2 percent after it reported a hefty jump in profit and raised its 2018 forecast. INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTION US factory output ticked up just 0.1 percent in March. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. factory output edged up a slight 0.1 percent in March, as strong production gains in motor vehicles and electronics were partially offset by declines in food and textiles. The Federal Reserve says factory output slowed from a 1.5 percent gain in February, though it has risen 3 percent over the past year. Stable growth worldwide has led to increased demand for consumer goods and business equipment, driving much of the business seen by manufacturers. The gains during the past 12 months have been led by automobiles, home electronics and metal products. But furniture, clothing and aerospace production has fallen over this period. Overall industrial production, which includes mines and utilities, rose 0.5 percent in March. Utility production jumped 3 percent last month, while mining output increased 1 percent. HOME CONSTRUCTION US home building rose slightly in March, led by apartments WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. builders broke ground on more apartment buildings last month, pushing up overall home construction 1.9 percent. The Commerce Department says housing starts rose in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million, driven by a big 16 percent gain in apartment buildings. Single-family home construction slipped 3.7 percent. Home construction has grown steadily since the housing crash bottomed out in 2012 and has emerged as a potential source of long-term economic growth. The pace of homebuilding is still below its long-run average of about 1.5 million houses and apartments a year. And millennials are increasingly moving out on their own and seeking to buy homes. Home construction rose nearly 11 percent in March from a year earlier, the government said. Single-family home construction is up 5.2 percent.

But its chief economist warns that the prospect of an escalating trade conflict ""threatens to undermine confidence and derail global growth prematurely."" The IMF predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.9 percent this year, up from the 2.7 percent it had forecast in January and up from the 2.3 percent growth the economy achieved last year. The U.S. economy will enjoy a boost through 2020 from tax cuts President Donald Trump signed into law in December, the IMF predicts. The lending agency kept its forecast for worldwide growth this year at 3.9 percent, which would be its fastest pace since 2011. CHINA-AUTO INDUSTRY China to allow full foreign ownership in auto industry BEIJING (AP) — China has announced plans to allow full foreign ownership of automakers in five years, ending restrictions that have strained relations with Washington and other trading partners. The Cabinet's planning commission said Tuesday it will lift limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year, followed by similar action for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020 and passenger vehicles in 2022. The announcement by the National Development and Reform Commission said, ""following a five-year transition period, all ownership restrictions will be lifted."" That would end rules requiring foreign automakers in China to work through local state-owned partners, an arrangement that forced them to share technology with potential competitors.

The automaker told employees this week there would be a four- or five-day production hiatus. The company says it warned of future production pauses when it shut down the line to improve automation in February . Tesla says shutdowns are common when a new model is launched and will improve production rates. But Autopacific analyst Dave Sullivan says manufacturing doesn't normally stop for days, especially nine months after production began. Tesla shares dropped 1 percent to $287.80 in morning trading. The broader markets were up about 1 percent. Model 3 production began in early July in Fremont, California. Pricing starts at about $35,000. BRITAIN-CAMBRIDGE-ANALYTICA Cambridge Analytica ex-CEO refuses to testify in UK LONDON (AP) — The chair of the British Parliament's media committee says that Cambridge Analytica's former CEO, Alexander Nix, says he will no longer testify at an upcoming session on fake news, citing an ongoing investigation by the information commissioner's office. Nix had been recalled by the committee to testify Wednesday following testimony by whistleblower Christopher Wylie on the use of data mine from some 87 million Facebook users in the campaign for Donald Trump's presidential election. Committee chair Damian Collins rejected Nix's reason for not appearing, as he has not ""not been charged with any criminal offence and there is no active legal proceedings."" Collins says Tuesday that the committee ""is minded to issue a formal summons for him to appear on a named day in the very near future.""

213,"DETROIT (AP) — In March of 2016, Keith Reynolds flew from California to Atlanta so he could claim his spot in line at 4 a.m., and get a three-hour head start on his West Coast competitors. Tesla was taking $1,000 deposits for its new electric car, the Model 3, priced starting at $35,000. And Reynolds had to have one. He managed to land near the top of the waiting list. Flash forward more than two years, through much-publicized production delays. Reynolds is still waiting. And now, like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide, he worries that the looming phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach. ""The tax credit was going to be huge,"" says Reynolds, 45, who works in digital advertising, lives in Laguna Hills, California, and drives a 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car. Last week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 — the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out. Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year. Then it drops to $3,750 for six months and $1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31, 2019. That means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $7,500 tax break — essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model's sticker price. Many Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out, predicted Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., an auto research and consulting firm. ""By then they will have been waiting for three years possibly,"" he said. Tesla wouldn't comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list. But if buyers bail, it could put the company's future in peril, costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history. Tesla is using the Model 3 to move from a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses. CEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year, but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company. In the first three months of this year it burned $1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont, California, factory. The company had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of March. In March, Moody's Investor Service sounded an alarm, downgrading Tesla's debt into junk territory and warning that it won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and drive profits. Musk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June. Like many of those still on the waiting list, Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $35,000 base. The cheapest version only comes in black, with other colors costing at least $1,000 more. At present, Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer-range battery packs. The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla's website, the lowest price was $49,000, beyond what he can afford. He wants the car badly enough that he'll spend over $40,000, as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $35,000. He'll hang on until the end of this year. Beyond that, he said he'll likely drop out if there's no federal credit and ""if no configuration options are made for the frugal, penny-pinchers like myself."" Others on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit. Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns. Most Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit — about 120,000 — are wealthier people who didn't need it to buy Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X, which can cost over $100,000, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid. He said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility. ""If you can afford to buy a $140,000 Tesla, you don't really need the incentive,"" he said. The only other automaker that's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors, which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.) Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April of 2016 because she believes in Musk's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero. Three months ago, she canceled her order, partly because of the delays, partly because she now wants a hatchback. Lindland also wondered if she'd ever get the car. ""I've already been on the list for two years,"" she said. ""I need all-wheel-drive, and I would have to wait another year."" She doesn't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week, and she is skeptical of the cars' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money, unable to service vehicles. Christian Kingery, a Seattle-area web developer, was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016. He wanted a loaded version with all-wheel-drive for rainy weather, but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits. He compromised and ordered a rear-drive version in April. But his delivery date was delayed, costing him the Washington credit, which he says was worth $3,000 before it expired in May. When all-wheel-drive became available, he switched his order, pushing delivery to September. Although Kingery is frustrated, he still wants the car.  ""Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing, in a way that no other carmaker is doing,"" he said. Like Reynolds and Lindland, he knows about the Model 3's impressive handling, 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen. He will just have to wait a little longer to drive one.",189,193,Auto Brand,611
219,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking leverage in immigration talks, President Donald Trump overstated the impact of a March 5 deadline after which he suggests a program protecting thousands of young immigrants from deportation would end. In fact, a recent court ruling has rendered that deadline basically meaningless. The president also made a puzzling plain-as-day exaggeration about the size of the TV audience that tuned in for his big speech to Congress last week. It capped another week of Trump statements — many of them made during his State of the Union address — that strained credulity, on immigration, energy, crime, health care and more. A look at some of the questionable claims: TRUMP: ""March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!"" — tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: Not so fast. A recent court ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration's plan to end the program has left the March 5 deadline all but moot for now. The deadline dates back to Sept. 5, when Trump announced that he was ending the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provided protection from deportation and work permits for about 800,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. as children and are now living here illegally. To lessen the blow, the administration announced that recipients whose status was set to expire before March 5 would be allowed to apply for renewals, so long as their applications were received within a month. Trump framed that as giving Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. But that timeline became far less significant when a federal court judge in San Francisco blocked Trump's action, saying young immigrants would suffer ""irreparable harm."" In response, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it was once again accepting DACA renewals, processing them just as they had before Trump's September announcement — including renewals for applicants whose permits expire after March 5. The judge's order to accept DACA renewals will remain in effect at least until the Supreme Court rules definitively. Trump is using the March 5 deadline as pressure for Democrats to come to the table, while Democrats will probably spend the next month arguing that a failure to act leaves DACA recipients vulnerable and living in fear. But without a looming deadline, it seems doubtful there would be the same urgency to get something done. ___ TRUMP: ""Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history."" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Not the highest in history. Trump's TV viewership as measured by Nielsen (45.6 million, as he said) trailed that for first State of the Union speeches by Barack Obama (48 million), George W. Bush (51.7 million) and Bill Clinton (46.8 million). Trump also got more TV viewers in his first speech to Congress a year ago (47.7 million) than in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. There is no reliable measure for how many people watched Tuesday on their computers or phones, a slice of viewership that is not counted by Nielsen. But Trump was not factoring in those viewers in his false claim. He cited the Nielsen number only. ___ TRUMP: ""We've signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."" — remarks Thursday to Republican lawmakers' retreat. THE FACTS: No. The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan's in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. He made the same claim Tuesday night and countless times before that. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in the fall put Trump's package as the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, Trump's plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product. ___ STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH: TRUMP: ""The third pillar (of my immigration plan) ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard to skill, merit or the safety of our people."" THE FACTS: The program is not nearly that random and it does address skills, merit and safety. The diversity visa program awards up to 50,000 green cards a year to people from underrepresented countries, largely in Africa. It requires applicants to have completed a high school education or have at least two years of experience in the past five years in a selection of fields identified by the Labor Department. Winners are then randomly selected by computer, from that pool of applicants who met the pre-conditions. Winners must submit to extensive background checks, just like any other immigrant. ____ TRUMP: ""We have ended the war on American energy."" THE FACTS: What war? Energy production was unleashed in past administrations, particularly Obama's. Advances in hydraulic fracturing before Trump became president made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, George W. Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline — a source of foreign oil, from Canada. ___ TRUMP: ""We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world."" THE FACTS: There's nothing new in that. The U.S. has long exported all sorts of energy, while importing even more. If Trump meant that the U.S. has become a net exporter of energy, he's rushing things along. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will become a net energy exporter in the next decade, primarily because of a boom in oil and gas production that began before Trump's presidency. The Trump White House has predicted that could happen sooner, by 2020. But that's not ""now."" ___ TRUMP: ""For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."" THE FACTS: The borders were far from open before his presidency, however imperfectly they may have been guarded. The government under George W. Bush and Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, and Bush extended fencing to cover nearly one-third of the border during his final years in office. The Obama administration deported more than 2 million immigrants during the eight years he was in office, more than in previous administrations. Border arrests, a useful if imperfect gauge of illegal crossings, have dropped sharply over the past decade. ___ TRUMP: ""Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades."" THE FACTS: He's wrong about recent decades. The auto industry has regularly been opening and expanding factories since before Trump became president. Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai's plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that ""Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan."" That's not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated. ___ TRUMP: ""We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone."" THE FACTS: No, it's not gone. It's going, in 2019. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines. Congress did repeal the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance ",7457,7461,Auto Brand,612

ITALY-FIAT CHRYSLER Fiat Chrysler is shaken without visionary CEO behind wheel MILAN (AP) — Fiat Chrysler shares have been volatile today as investors express worry about the exit of ailing CEO Sergio Marchionne, whose driven and creative management style has been the company's fortune. Shares in the Italian-American carmaker closed down 1.5 percent after a harder 4 percent opening tumble in the first trading since Marchionne's grave health condition was disclosed over the weekend. Trading was volatile, especially after news that the head of the big European operations, who had been considered one of Marchionne's potential successors, was quitting. Ferrari, where Marchionne was also replaced at the helm, closed down about 5 percent. The Fiat Chrysler board on Saturday named long-time Jeep executive Mike Manley as CEO, unexpectedly accelerating a transition that was planned for early next year. The company said the 66-year-old Marchionne suffered complications from shoulder surgery in Zurich, Switzerland last month that worsened in recent days, and that he could not resume his duties. TESLA-STOCK Tesla stock skids on report it asked suppliers for refunds NEW YORK (AP) — Shares of Tesla tumbled today on reports that the company asked suppliers for refunds to help it turn a profit. A memo provided to The Wall Street Journal shows the electric car maker asked a supplier to return what it calls a meaningful amount of money on its payments since 2016. The memo said all suppliers were being asked to help the company become profitable. Tesla declined to comment on the specific memo, but confirmed that it is seeking price reductions from suppliers for projects, some of which date back that far. The request raised more questions about Tesla's cash position. The 15-year-old company has reported only two quarterly profits and has never made a profit for a full year. It is spending about $1 billion a quarter as it ramps up manufacturing of the Model 3 sedan and had $2.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. INDIA-IRAN OIL SANCTIONS India cuts oil imports from Iran by a quarter in past year NEW DELHI (AP) — Facing the threat of U.S. oil sanctions on Iran, India continued to rely on Iraq as its top oil supplier in the April-June quarter, followed by Iran and Saudi Arabia. India's petroleum minister says the country bought 7.27 million metric tons of oil from Iraq, 5.67 million tons from Iran and 5.22 million tons from Saudi Arabia during the three-month period. India's state-run refineries bought 9.8 million tons of Iranian oil in financial 2017-18 compared to 13.04 million tons a year earlier, a nearly 25 percent decline. India's financial year runs from April to March. India imported 29.66 million tons of Iraqi oil in 2017-18 compared to 24.79 tons a year earlier. The petroleum minister didn't say what steps India is taking in response to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which are to come into force on Nov. 4. PAPA JOHN'S-POISON PILL Papa John's attempts to ward off founder with poison pill LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Papa John's is attempting to ward off its disgraced founder by adopting a poison-pill plan. Founder John Schnatter (SHNAH'-tur) resigned as chairman this month after his use of a racial slur during a media training session was revealed. He stepped down late last year as CEO after becoming enmeshed in the national anthem issue involving players, saying it was hurting sales. Schnatter, who later said his resignation was a mistake, is still the pizza chain's biggest shareholder, holding just short of 30 percent of all stock. The company, based in Louisville, Kentucky, said late Sunday it will put its shareholder rights plan in place for a year.

271,SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Wall Street Journal is reporting that government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors. The Journal cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Fox Business News was the first to report the SEC's action. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with an August 7 tweet revealing that he lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell. The subpoena signals regulators have now opened a formal investigation into whether Musk was telling the truth in his tweet.,101,105,Auto Brand,621
275,NEW YORK (AP) — Shares of Tesla are down sharply after a report that the company asked suppliers for refunds to help it turn a profit. A memo provided to The Wall Street Journal shows Tesla asked a supplier to return what it calls a meaningful amount of money on its payments since 2016. The memo said all suppliers were being asked to help the company become profitable. The request raises more questions about Tesla's cash position. The 15-year-old company has never reported an annual profit. It is spending about $1 billion a quarter as it ramps up manufacturing of its Model 3 sedan. It had $2.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. Tesla stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trading Monday.,26,30,Auto Brand,622
293,"MUNICH (AP) — Charging an electric car away from home can be an exercise in uncertainty — hunting for that one lonely station at the back of a rest-area parking lot and hoping it's working. In Europe, some of the biggest automakers are out to remove such anxieties from the battery-only driving experience and encourage electric-vehicle sales by building a highway network of fast charging stations. The idea is to let drivers plug in, charge in minutes instead of hours, and speed off on their way — from Norway to southern Italy and Portugal to Poland. Much is at stake for the automakers, which include Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Ford. Their joint venture, Munich-based Ionity, is pushing to roll out its network in time to service the next generation of battery-only cars coming on the market starting next year. They're aiming to win back some of the market share for electric luxury car sales lost to Tesla, which has its own, proprietary fast-charging network. Despite a slower-than-expected start, Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch told The Associated Press in an interview he's ""confident"" the company will reach its goal of 400 ultra-fast charging stations averaging six charging places each by 2020. The idea is ""to be able to drive long distances with battery electric vehicles, across Europe and to have the same experience at each station, meaning a very easy and comfortable customer journey,"" Hajesch said, speaking at  the company's Munich headquarters near the 1972 Olympic stadium. The idea is to break electric cars out of the early adopter niche, in which they are charged slowly overnight at home and used for short commutes. ""The sites we are looking for are really the A-sites,"" he said, ""directly at the autobahn. Not down the road, not driving five kilometers into the next industrial area and finding a charging station somewhere, without light, or any amenities around, but right at the autobahn."" ""If you're going from Hamburg to Munich, because it's a weekend trip to friends, typically you do not have much time,"" he said. So what counts will be ""the speed of recharging your vehicles, and at the same time finding maybe some amenities: maybe a coffee, getting a newspaper or whatever."" Ionity opened its first station April 17 at a rest stop off the A61 highway near the small town of Niederzissen,  50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Bonn in western Germany. The six high-speed chargers are operating in ""welcome mode,"" meaning they're free until May 31. After that, Ionity plans to charge for the power, which it seeks to obtain from renewable sources. Ionity has agreements for some 300 sites, working with fueling station and rest stop landlords. The average distance between stations will be 120 kilometers (75 miles). More charging availability is what it will take to get an environmentally aware car buyer like Rainer Hoedt to choose a battery-only vehicle. The 58-year-old Berlin geography teacher is a proud owner of a Mitsubishi Outlander, a plug-in hybrid that combines internal combustion with a battery he can charge overnight. The battery-only range of 50 kilometers (30 miles) lets him drive emissions free for daily trips at home. But a family vacation of more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the Baltic Sea was a different story. Hoedt had to drive on internal combustion before finding a lone charging station as he approached his destination, using the goingelectric.de website. ""It was right next to the highway, there was one charging station and we were lucky that it was free,"" he said. But he couldn't find a charging station he could use by the seashore. On the way back, he was able to charge at a rest stop, but only by asking a non-electric car owner to move his vehicle away from the lone charging pole. A battery-only car might never have made it home. And he couldn't use one to visit his cousin 650 kilometers (400 miles) away in Rosenheim. ""I looked at the option... The infrastructure is still so bad, I just don't want to risk that I get stranded,"" he said. ""Once the infrastructure gets better, that might be my next car."" Tesla has shown how charging infrastructure can drive vehicle sales. It has 1,229 stations with 9,623 fast chargers in Europe alone, where it has cut into Mercedes and BMW's sales of luxury cars. But it has its own proprietary plug. Ionity is using the CCS plug backed by the European Union as a common standard for all. In both the U.S. and Europe, the situation is roughly similar:  More chargers available in jurisdictions where government strongly backs electric vehicles, such as California, Norway or the Netherlands. Elsewhere, chargers get can harder to find for long stretches along rural highways. Volkswagen, which agreed to invest in low-emission driving to settle charges it cheated on diesel emissions, is building 300 highway charging sites in the U.S. by June 2019 through its Electrify America unit. Japan has 40,000 charging points, exceeding its 34,000 gas stations, according to Nissan — but many of those are private garages. Ionity is counting on the large 350-kilowatt capacity of its publicly available chargers — almost three times the 120 kilowatts per vehicle of Tesla's Superchargers. No car currently on the market can make full use of 350 kilowatt charging capacity. But they're coming: in 2019 Porsche plans to introduce the Mission E. Porsche says that the sleek, low-slung sports car will take 15 minutes to charge for 400 kilometers (250 miles) more driving. Tesla and its founder, Elon Musk, ""showed it's not enough to just build electric cars"" without also building charging infrastructure, said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the CAR Center Automotive Research at the University of Duisberg-Essen. The automakers ""are late, but it's better than it was... it remains the case that without Elon Musk the carmakers would not have realized this,"" he said.",909,913,Auto Brand,623
309,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla is recalling 123,000 sedans worldwide to fix a problem with the power-assisted steering. The recall covers all Model S sedans built before April of 2016. Three bolts holding the power steering motor in place can corrode and either come loose or break, possibly causing a loss of power steering. Manual steering would still work. Tesla says the problem happens infrequently in places where salt is used to clear snow and ice from roads. It's recalling all the cars even in warm-weather states just in case. No crashes or injuries have been reported. Service centers will replace the bolts with ones that are more corrosion-resistant. Owners will be notified Thursday by email.

346,"GENEVA (AP) — Global automakers are rolling out more electric vehicles at the Geneva International Motor Show as they try to challenge Tesla and get ahead of a disruptive shift in transportation toward lower-emission and autonomous vehicles. For the European carmakers, the mood at the event could be unsettled by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat this weekend to slap tariffs on the region's manufacturers in a potential trade war. And the three big German manufacturers — Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW — will grasp the opportunity to highlight their high-tech creations amid their continued trouble with diesel technology, such as the legal attempts to ban diesel in German cities and the scandal over exposing monkeys to exhaust in lab tests. The carmakers will show off their wares during press days Monday evening through Wednesday; the show opens to the public Thursday and runs through March 18. Here are the top themes. ___ ELECTRIC AND AUTONOMOUS The biggest trend in autos is the race to make new technologies affordable and functional. Some of the vehicles on show — such as Volkswagen's autonomous and battery-driven I.D. Vizzion — will be concepts not yet ready for production. Others will have vehicles that are ready to go on sale in coming months, such as Jaguar Land Rover with the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-driven SUV advertising 310 miles (498 kilometers) of range and rapid-charging capability. Mercedes-Benz will have an addition to its EQ electric brand. Hyundai will show its Kona Electric, with either a 300-kilometer (186-mile) or 470-kilometer (292-mile) range. Luxury carmakers like BMW and Jaguar are eager to grab back some of the sales of high-end vehicles taken by Tesla with its electric Model S high-performance sedan and Model X SUV. When it comes to technological change there will be more than vehicles to talk about. The German automakers and Ford are working to build a network of fast-charging stations across Europe through their joint venture, Ionity. The idea is to make electric vehicles more appealing by enabling longer trips. Currently, many electric models are charged over several hours at home at night and used for short commutes, limiting their use. Ionity's 350 kilowatt-per-hour charging capacity could cut charge times to 15 minutes or less. Automakers are under pressure to come up with vehicles propelled by something other than internal combustion engines to comply with government efforts to reduce air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for global warming. The issue became even more pressing after a German court said last week that polluted cities can ban older-model diesels. Diesel sales had already slipped after Volkswagen's 2015 scandal over cheating on emissions tests. Autonomous vehicles could herald a shift to transportation as a service with less incentive to own a car. Analysts at IHS Markit estimate that autonomous cars will have their first significant sales volume with 51,000 units in 2021 and surpass 33 million per year by 2040. ___ MONKEY BUSINESS All three German auto makers have condemned the 2014 experiment in which Volkswagen had macaque monkeys exposed to diesel exhaust at a lab in New Mexico. The tests were commissioned through a now-disbanded organization whose board had representatives from BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler. They have said they're investigating how the tests happened. The show won't erase public indignation or media questions but at least offers a chance to talk about something other than a PR disaster. ___ SEEN THAT ALREADY Some of the more important vehicles at the show have already been revealed as companies use stand-alone events to show off their new cars rather than putting them on display in a crowd of other vehicles. That's the case with Mercedes-Benz A-Class, its small entry model hatchback that was unveiled Feb. 2 in Amsterdam. The car features voice-activated control of navigation, phone, music and heating and air conditioning somewhat like Amazon and Google's devices for home use. The Jaguar I-Pace had a digital unveiling from Graz, Austria on Thursday ahead of the show — showing it beating two Tesla models in a race. ___ IF YOU HAVE TO ASK HOW MUCH Geneva is typically a place to show off gorgeous, extremely fast and very, very expensive vehicles. A taste: Luxury sports car maker McLaren offers the low-slung Senna, named after the race driver Ayrton Senna. Its 800 horsepower turbocharged V8 engine takes it to a top speed of 340 kph (211 mph).  Just 500 of the sleek, carbon-fiber vehicles will be built, hand-assembled at the company's production center in Woking, Surrey, England. The price:  750,000 pounds including tax, which translates to $1.03 million at today's exchange rate. Want one? Sorry. The company says it has buyers for all of them.",135,139,Auto Brand,626
361,"DETROIT (AP) — Cars and trucks with electronic driver assist systems may not see stopped vehicles and could even steer you into a crash if you're not paying attention, an insurance industry group warns. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, in a paper titled ""Reality Check,"" issued the warning Tuesday after testing five of the systems from Tesla, Mercedes, BMW and Volvo on a track and public roads. The upshot is while they could save your life, the systems can fail under many circumstances. ""We have found situations where the vehicles under semi-automated control may do things that can put you and your passengers at risk, and so you really need to be on top of it to prevent that from happening,"" said David Zuby, the institute's chief research officer. Among the scariest found by the Virginia-based institute was with the system in two Tesla vehicles, the Model S and Model 3. The institute tested the system with the adaptive cruise control turned off, but automatic braking on. At 31 miles per hour, both Teslas braked and mitigated a crash but still hit a stationary balloon. They were the only two models that failed to stop in time during tests on a track. Yet when the adaptive cruise control, which keeps a set distance from cars in front, is activated, the Teslas braked earlier and gentler and avoided the balloon, the agency said. On the road, the institute's engineers found that all the vehicles but Tesla's Model 3 failed to respond to stopped vehicles ahead of them, the institute said. The systems tested, in the Teslas, BMW's 5-Series, the Volvo S-90 and the Mercedes E-Class, are among the best in the business right now and have been rated ""superior"" in previous IIHS tests. Zuby said the systems do increase safety but the tests show they are not 100 percent reliable. Many of the scenarios discovered by IIHS are covered in the vehicles' owner's manuals, which tell drivers they have to pay attention. But Zuby said not many people read their owner's manuals in detail. Even though the systems have names like Tesla's ""Autopilot"" or Volvo's ""Pilot Assist,"" they are not self-driving vehicles, Zuby said. ""They will help you with some steering or speed control but you really better be paying attention because they don't always get it right,"" he said. Many of the cars' lane-centering systems failed, especially on curves or hills. The BMW, Model S and Volvo ""steered toward or across the lane line regularly,"" requiring driver intervention, the IIHS said. The IIHS-affiliated Highway Loss Data Institute analyzed Tesla insurance losses to find that automatic braking and other crash avoidance features on the Model S were helpful in reducing property damage and bodily injury claims.  But adding ""Autopilot,"" which includes automatic steering and lane-changing, only helped to lower collision claims. The institute, which in the past has developed tests that made the auto industry strengthen vehicle structures, also said the California crash of a Tesla Model X SUV in March that killed a man shows the limits of the technology and the tendency of some drivers to misuse it. The group also said a pedestrian death in Arizona involving an Uber autonomous vehicle shows the dangers of testing self-driving vehicles on public roads. IIHS is developing ratings for driver assist systems and eventually will make recommendations on regulations for fully autonomous vehicles, Zuby said. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the automakers.",348,352,Auto Brand,627

377,SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Wall Street Journal is reporting that government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors. The Journal cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Fox Business News was the first to report the SEC's action. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with an August 7 tweet revealing that he lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell. The subpoena signals regulators have now opened a formal investigation into whether Musk was telling the truth in his tweet.,101,105,Auto Brand,621
385,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the California crash of a Tesla Model S electric car that may have been operating under its semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" system. It's the second time the board has looked into a Tesla crash, and likely means that it wants information about whether Autopilot was on and if its sensors somehow failed to see a stopped firetruck Monday on Interstate 405 in Culver City near Los Angeles. The board sent two investigators to Culver City, NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said Wednesday. The NTSB said on Twitter that investigators will focus on driver and vehicle factors. The NTSB in September determined that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. The California investigation comes as Congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. The systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes. Tesla wouldn't say if Autopilot was working at the time of the Culver City crash, but said in a statement Monday that drivers must stay attentive when it's in use. The company would not comment on the investigation. In Monday's crash, the California Highway Patrol and the Culver City Fire Department confirmed the southbound Tesla hit the rear of the firetruck but could not confirm if Autopilot was operating, The Mercury News of San Jose reported. The firetruck was parked in the left emergency and carpool lane with emergency lights flashing to block a previous crash on Monday morning, Culver City Fire Battalion Chief Ken Powell told the newspaper. The Tesla suffered significant damage, but the driver showed no significant injuries, Powell said. The Model S Autopilot is a level 2 on a self-driving scale of 0 to 5. Level 5 vehicles can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances. Level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways, which don't have intersections. Autopilot keeps a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it. It also can change lanes and brake automatically. Drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary. In the Florida crash, which killed an Ohio man driving the Tesla, NTSB investigators found that the sedan's cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. Rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles being followed to prevent rear-end collisions. The NTSB re-issued previous recommendations that the government require all new cars and trucks to be equipped with technology that wirelessly transmits the vehicles' location, speed, heading and other information to other vehicles in order to prevent collisions. The NTSB also recommended that automakers develop systems to make sure drivers pay attention while using semi-autonomous systems, other than detecting the pressure of hands on the steering wheel. The driver in the Florida crash had his hands on the sedan's steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle's cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash, investigators found. Tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using Autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. If the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using Autopilot, the company has said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates auto safety, declined last year to issue a recall or fine Tesla as a result of the crash, but it warned automakers they aren't to treat semi-autonomous cars as if they were fully self-driving. ____ Associated Press Writer Joan Lowy contributed from Washington.",104,108,Auto Brand,629

421,"DETROIT (AP) — After leaving a leadership post at Google's autonomous car unit, Chris Urmson and two other self-driving vehicle pioneers are back in the race with a new company that will rival their former employers. Aurora Innovation on Thursday announced that it had signed partnerships with Hyundai and Volkswagen to help the automakers develop autonomous vehicles, a major step in the tightening competition. Urmson, who led autonomous vehicle development efforts at Alphabet Inc.'s Google for more than seven years, started Aurora last year with former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell. He talked about the partnerships, how to make money on autonomous vehicles and when we all might be riding in them in an interview with The Associated Press. Responses have been edited for length and clarity: Q: How will you make money on the Hyundai and VW deals?  Will you sell them your self-driving system or are these broader partnerships? A: We did not disclose financial terms on these. But I can tell you that we're a for-profit company. We will work out long-term arrangements and share them when ready.  We're going to focus on the fully autonomous space, where the occupant will be free to use their time in the vehicle how they want to. Q: Other companies and many analysts have said the big money to be made in autonomous cars is providing transportation as a service, and that the vehicles and self-driving technology could become lower-profit commodities. Will Aurora be part of providing a ride service? A: One of the first applications is providing transportation for people in self-driven vehicles. It'll deliver safety benefits. It'll deliver improved access to mobility. It will improve the quality of life in cities. The way the economics play out over time is still far from foregone, combining self-driving capability, a vehicle and a (ride-sharing) network. We still don't know which of those pieces will be dominant or if they will find a happy equilibrium. Q: When do you see autonomous vehicles in widespread use? At Google you said a company goal was to have them in place so your son didn't have to get a driver's license when he turns 16 in 2019. A:  Widespread use, no. I don't think that's going to be the case. But I do believe you will probably see places where he could get around without driving. We're starting to see interesting things happen in Arizona (Google's Waymo autonomous car unit this year, for instance, will begin a test carrying passengers in self-driving minivans without a human backup driver in the Phoenix area). We'll see how the rollouts happen and how quickly we can get the technology to scale. Q: Is the technology moving toward public use faster than you had expected? A: Two or three years ago the level of investment in the space was nowhere near what it is today. The overall velocity of the field has increased dramatically. There are more people working on it. It's a very hard problem. I think we're learning more about how hard the problem is. Q: What's standing in the way? A: One is getting the technology so it deals with those hard problems of driving, dealing with these rare events where the system gets pushed to really have to perform well. Second is actually manufacturing and bringing it to market at scale. We think we can go and tackle that first problem. We know how to bring the right technology to bear, how to build the right self-driving system. Then we partner with automotive companies. For the most part the folks that are working here believe in the social good of this technology. One and a quarter million people dying on the world's roads, you don't address that by having five cars in a test fleet.",558,562,Auto Brand,633

453,"DETROIT (AP) — A wireless update of antilock braking software improved the stopping distance of Tesla's electric Model 3, prompting Consumer Reports to reverse course and give the car its ""Recommended Buy"" rating. The magazine said Wednesday that the update cut 19 feet off the car's stopping distance from 60 miles per hour.  A previous test — the results of which were released a little more than a week ago — found that it took 152 feet for the Model S compact car to stop from 60, the longest braking distance of any modern car the magazine has tested. The improved braking raised the car's score high enough for it to receive the coveted recommendation. But Consumer Reports still has concerns over wind noise, a stiff ride, and the touch-screen controls that could distract a driver. After the first round of testing was made public, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to fix the problem within days. Consumer Reports says it was told by Tesla that the software helps the brakes adapt to variations in how they are used and how they respond in different environmental conditions. On Twitter Wednesday, Musk wrote that he appreciates the ""high-quality critical feedback"" from Consumer Reports and said that noise and ride comfort already had been addressed. Another software update will address the controls, he wrote, without elaborating. Musk told the magazine last week that Tesla had already made production changes to address wind noise, the harsh ride and an uncomfortable rear seat, Consumer Reports said in a statement. Consumer Reports said it will rent another Model 3 from Tesla to check on the changes and will report back on the results. The magazine bought a Model 3 for the first test and said it doesn't normally rent test vehicles. The Model 3 is Tesla's first attempt to appeal to mass-market buyers. The car that starts at $35,000 but can run as high as $78,000 has been plagued by production delays. Tesla's software update was done either via the car's cellular connection or a wireless internet link, depending on how the owner configures the car, according to Tesla. Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, said that in 19 years of work for the magazine he has not seen a car's track performance improve with a wireless update. Musk pledged in a tweet last week that the braking improvements would make the Model 3 best in its class. But Consumer Reports said the stopping distance was not class leading and the further updates may be necessary. The magazine also said nearly all of the Model 3's controls are on a center touch screen direction with no gauges on the dashboard and few buttons inside the car. This forces drivers to take several steps to do simple tasks and can cause driver distraction, the magazine said. Consumer Reports also said it got a record 350 miles of range per charge with a long-range version of the Model 3 when it's set on a high mode to recharge batteries with energy from braking.",96,100,Auto Brand,638
454,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. increased production of its Model 3 mass-market car in the first quarter but still fell far short of the numbers it promised last summer. The Palo Alto, California, company says it made just under 9,800 Model 3s from January through March. That's four times what it made in the fourth quarter. But it's still only a fraction of the 20,000 per month that CEO Elon Musk promised when Tesla first started making the car. The news, released just before the markets opened Tuesday, pushed Tesla's shares up about 3 percent to $259.54 in early trading. Still, they have fallen nearly 15 percent since the start of the year on a string of bad news for the 15-year-old company. Tesla says it made just under 35,000 vehicles total in the quarter including the Models S and X. That's a 40 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. The company predicted that Model 3 production will climb rapidly through the second quarter and reach about 5,000 vehicles per week around early June. Tesla predicted high sales volume, good gross profit margins and strong cash flow. ""As a result Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,"" the company said in a regulatory filing. The Model 3, with a starting price of around $35,000, is the car that's most important to Tesla's future. It's the company's first lower-cost, high-volume car and is crucial to its goal of becoming a profitable, mainstream automaker. Tesla at one point had more than 500,000 potential buyers on the waiting list for the Model 3. But in a statement Tuesday, the company conceded that some had canceled, refusing to give numbers. Tesla said Model 3 reservations ""remained stable"" through the first quarter. The cancelations, it said, were ""almost entirely due to delays in production in general and delays in availability of certain planned options,"" including dual motor all-wheel-drive versions and a smaller battery pack. Tesla said it doubled the weekly production rate of the Model 3 last quarter by addressing production and parts supply bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment. The company said it delivered 29,980 vehicles during the quarter. The increased production comes after a succession of bad news for the company this year, which started with low production numbers in the fourth quarter when the company made only 2,425 Model 3s. Then, two federal agencies opened investigations into crashes of two of its models on California freeways, including one that killed a man near Mountain View. In the Mountain View-area crash, Tesla said last weekend that the Model X SUV was operating on the company's semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" system when it hit a freeway barrier. The company hasn't said whether a Model S sedan that crashed near Los Angeles earlier in the year was operating on Autopilot. Late in March, Moody's Investor Service downgraded Tesla's corporate debt further into junk status. Unsecured notes are now ""subject to very high credit risk."" The agency said future ratings will depend on whether Tesla can meet Model 3 production targets. Moody's also wrote in a note that Tesla likely will need to raise capital soon. Its liquidity isn't enough to cover $3.7 billion it needs for operations, capital expenses and convertible debt maturities through early 2019.",34,38,Auto Brand,639

CHINA-US-TRADE China says ""fully prepared"" if trade war kicks off this week BEIJING (AP) — China says it's ""fully prepared"" for a trade war with the United States if it kicks off in earnest on Friday. Hopes are dwindling for the world's two biggest economies to reach a breakthrough this week before Washington starts charging tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports. Beijing has pledged to retaliate with equal tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods. The Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that China will be ""fully prepared to take a package of necessary measures"" to safeguard its national interests. U.S. companies ranging from whiskey distilleries to automakers like Ford and Tesla could be hit if China ramps up retaliatory measures. President Donald Trump has accused China of unfairly acquiring U.S. technology and limiting market access for finance and technology firms — claims that China denies. CHINA-CURRENCY China central banker says currency slide under observation BEIJING (AP) — The head of China's central bank says he's closely watching the recent slide in the value of the yuan against the U.S. dollar, but the country's economic fundamentals remain strong. Yi Gang was quoted as saying Tuesday that the yuan's depreciation reflects the strengthening of the dollar and ""the effect of external uncertainties."" The yuan's 3 percent decline against the dollar over the past two weeks is largely seen as reflecting fears over a possible trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Punishing U.S. tariffs on some Chinese imports are due to take effect Friday, with China planning tariffs on an equal amount of U.S. exports. Despite that, Yi said financial risks were under control and the China's international balance of payments and currency flows were stable. CHINA-US-EMBASSY WARNING China issues warning for citizens traveling to US BEIJING (AP) — China has issued a safety warning to its citizens traveling to the United States amid rising tensions between the sides over accusations of unfair trading practices and other disputes. The warning issued late last week and posted on the Website of the Chinese Embassy in Washington touches on issues from the high cost of medical treatment in the U.S. to the importance of guarding against crime and terrorist attacks and the powers wielded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Tuesday that China's government was merely fulfilling its duty to warn travelers of ""potential dangers."" U.S. tariffs meant to punish China for allegedly unfair trading practices are due to take effect Friday. Friction has also grown over the South China Sea and Taiwan. TRUMP-HARLEY-DAVIDSON Trump courting other motorcycle companies after Harley WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says the administration is courting motorcycle companies that want to move to the U.S. after Harley-Davidson said it's moving some assembly overseas. Harley-Davidson drew Trump's wrath last week after the manufacturer announced it's moving production of motorcycles sold in Europe to facilities outside the U.S. The company blamed the decision on tariffs imposed by the European Union to retaliate for tariffs Trump imposed on a host of EU products. Trump says Tuesday on Twitter that Harley-Davidson customers aren't happy with the Milwaukee-based company's announcement. He also notes that sales were down 7 percent in 2017, but a sales drop last year cannot be attributed to Harley-Davidson's announcement last week. Trump didn't name any motorcycle companies. The White House had no immediate comment. IRAN-OIL Iran's president warns over US push against buying Iran oil TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is warning that regional oil supply could be jeopardized if the United States manages to get its allies to stop buying Tehran's oil. Rouhani spoke to Iranian expatriates in Switzerland during his visit there on Monday. He says the U.S. has threatened not to allow Iran to continue exporting its oil. The Iranian state TV broadcast his remarks. Rouhani didn't elaborate but when pressured in the past, Iran has threatened to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz though which one third of the world's oil supply passes. Iran is OPEC's second-largest crude exporter with more than 2 million barrels a day. After the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran, Washington has been pushing allies to cut oil imports from Iran altogether by November. EU-BREXIT UK business group warns patience running out on Brexit LONDON (AP) — A major British business group says companies need answers over post-Brexit relations with the EU, as Prime Minister Theresa May tries to unite her feuding government around a common vision for future trade with the bloc.

Director-general Adam Marshall said Tuesday that ""business patience is reaching breaking point."" He says questions affecting ""the livelihoods of millions of people remain unanswered.""

The bloc has warned Britain it must provide realistic proposals soon or risk crashing out without a deal. SWITZERLAND-GLENCORE-US US demands Glencore documents to check on corruption GENEVA (AP) — Shares in commodities giant Glencore have plunged after the company was ordered to hand over documents and records to the U.S. Department of Justice for its compliance with corruption and money laundering rules. The company, which is based in Baar, Switzerland, said Tuesday the requested documents relate to its business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela from 2007 onwards. It said it is reviewing the subpoena. Shares in the company, which sources and trades raw materials like metals and grains, dropped about 10 percent in London, where they are listed. In Congo, Glencore operates mines for copper and cobalt, a key material for the production of mobile phone batteries. In Nigeria and Venezuela, it produces oil and coal. FORD EXPLORER-FUMES Advocacy group seeks Ford Explorer recall due to fumes DETROIT (AP) — A nonprofit auto safety advocacy group is asking Ford to recall 1.35 million Explorer SUVs due to continued complaints of exhaust fumes in the passenger compartments. The Center for Auto Safety says it found 44 complaints in a government database about fumes and potential carbon monoxide after owners had taken Explorers in for free repairs in a customer service campaign. The center made its request in a letter to Ford CEO Jim Hackett this week. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating the problem for two years in police and civilian Explorers from the 2011 through 2017 model years, but it has not reached a conclusion. Ford says Explorers are safe, owner complaints have decreased and the free service has addressed the exhaust odors.",550,554,Auto Brand,641
519,"DETROIT (AP) — Federal investigators say they have booted electric car maker Tesla Inc. from a group that's investigating a fatal crash in California that involved an SUV using the company's Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board said it removed Tesla as a party to the investigation after the company prematurely made information public. ""Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash."" Tesla, however, disputed the claim and said it withdrew from the agreement two days earlier, after being told that it would be removed if it made additional statements before the NTSB finished its probe in the next 12 to 24 months. The company said it released information to correct ""misleading"" claims being made about Autopilot creating safety problems. In a statement about the escalating dispute, Tesla said it would file a complaint with Congress and accused the NTSB of being more concerned with ""press headlines"" than promoting safety. Removing a party to an investigation is rare but has happened in the past, according to the agency. Companies and other organizations can become parties in a probe because they can give technical help and share sensitive information. The move means that the NTSB will no longer share information about the March 23 crash of a Tesla Model X SUV on U.S. 101 near Mountain View in Silicon Valley. The driver, Walter Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple, was killed in the crash. In a statement on March 30, Tesla confirmed that the semi-autonomous Autopilot system was operating at the time of the crash and seemed to blame the crash on Huang. The company said Huang didn't have his hands on the steering wheel for six seconds before the impact and also received several warnings from the vehicle. Shortly after Tesla released the information, an NTSB spokesman said the agency was ""unhappy"" about the disclosure. Tesla tells drivers that its Autopilot system — which uses cameras, radar and computers to keep speed, change lanes and automatically stop vehicles — requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel in order to take control to avoid accidents. The Palo Alto, California, company said its vehicle logs showed Huang took no action to stop the Model X from crashing into a concrete lane divider. The company said the crash was worsened by a missing or damaged safety shield on the end of the lane divider. The NTSB, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is looking into the crash, as well as another Tesla crash in January near Los Angeles in which a Model S sedan smashed into a firetruck parked on a freeway. Tesla would not say whether the Model S in that crash was operating on Autopilot. David Friedman, a former NHTSA acting administrator who now is director of cars and product policy for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, said the Tesla-NTSB spat could delay the investigation if the agency doesn't have all the electronic information it needs from the company. The agency has legal options if Tesla isn't forthcoming, he said, but those take time and taxpayer dollars. The NTSB, he said, has never been focused on publicity, and it has the authority to investigate new technology like Autopilot. ""If anything, the NTSB is shining a spotlight on Tesla because of their innovation,"" Friedman said. Consumers Union has called for Tesla to stop testing the cars with its buyers, and Friedman said the company shouldn't use the name Autopilot because it implies that the cars can drive themselves. ""You should name it so that it is clear what it can and can't do,"" he said. In the crash that killed Huang, a Tesla spokeswoman would not directly answer questions about why the SUV didn't spot the freeway barrier and stop before the collision. The spokeswoman referred to a statement saying that Tesla owners' manuals have warnings and notifications stating that a driver should not depend on the car's autosteer system to pick the right driving path. It also says automatic emergency braking ""is not designed to avoid a collision and is not a substitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance"" from other vehicles. In its statement Thursday, Tesla accused the NTSB of focusing on the ""safest cars in America"" while ignoring less-safe vehicles. Tesla says there is one auto death in the U.S. for every 86 million miles driven, but for Tesla vehicles, it's one death for every 320 million miles. The NTSB makes recommendations to prevent crashes, while NHTSA has authority to fine automakers, push for recalls and seek regulations.",77,81,Auto Brand,642

The New York Times reported Friday that the investigations come after the Center for Investigative Reporting catalogued a series of workplace injuries at Tesla. California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health said Friday that it had opened an investigation into an unspecified incident. The agency earlier said it was investigating an incident that resulted in a 30-year-old subcontractor breaking his jaw. Tesla officials say the center incorrectly counted injuries that occurred away from the factory in Fremont, which is 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of San Francisco. The automaker says the reporting also relied on unspecified inaccurate information. Tesla said Friday that it takes all worker injuries seriously and is cooperating with the investigations.",105,109,Auto Brand,643
570,"DETROIT (AP) — Two technology giants announced major new investments in self-driving vehicles Thursday, bringing the world a step closer to a time when autonomous cars are a part of everyday life — a reality that General Motors aims to achieve in some places as early as next year. The deals, and other ongoing negotiations, show that the technology is authentic and it's accelerating. ""It's all starting to coalesce into something that's more real,"" said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid, who closely follows autonomous vehicle developments. SoftBank, a giant Japanese tech investment firm, announced Thursday it would spend $2.25 billion for a 20 percent stake in GM's autonomous vehicle business. Then Waymo, Google's self-driving operation, said it would buy up to 62,000 more minivans from Fiat Chrysler to expand its soon-to-start ride-hailing venture. Not to be outdone, Uber's new CEO said at a Wednesday conference that he's in talks with Waymo about adding Waymo self-driving vehicles to the Uber network to carry passengers, although there was no indication that was imminent. ""Everything in the autonomous world is moving very quickly,"" said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst for Kelley Blue Book. Also, as part of the Waymo-Fiat Chrysler announcement, the companies said they are discussing use of Waymo technology in Fiat-Chrysler self-driving vehicles that would be sold to the public. That raises the possibility that personal car ownership won't die if robotaxis become ubiquitous. Waymo, the current front-runner, already is testing self-driving Chrysler vans with no human backup behind the wheel in Arizona. The company plans to start an app-based autonomous ride-hailing service there later this year. At GM, widely viewed as being in second place, the SoftBank cash infusion will help the autonomous unit named GM Cruise to roll out a robotaxi service in at least one major city starting next year, CEO Mary Barra said. The deal, the largest yet between a technology investment firm and an old-line automaker, boosted General Motors Co. shares to their biggest one-day gain since the automaker returned to the public markets in 2010 after a trip through bankruptcy protection. The stock closed Thursday up nearly 13 percent at 42.70. GM Cruise would remain a wholly owned subsidiary of GM with the automaker keeping roughly 80 percent of the business. SoftBank can trade its stake for shares in GM if Cruise isn't spun off into a new company within seven years. The stock soared because investors are starting to realize that GM is a serious player in automated mobility, Abuelsamid said. But analysts were cautious about predicting a future of self-driving cars everywhere. Lindland said the recent Arizona crash in which a self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed a pedestrian, as well as crashes involving Tesla Inc.'s semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" feature, have rattled public confidence in the technology. ""Even as the industry is pushing forward and collaborating and getting billions of dollars in investment, we can't leave the consumer behind,"" Lindland said. The announcements keep the front-runners on pace to start carrying passengers within the next couple of years in small-scale operations in a few metro areas, Abuelsamid said. But he said it still will take until the middle of the next decade before self-driving taxis are ubiquitous worldwide. Although he views Waymo as having the lead in the autonomous vehicle race, Abuelsamid said GM's alliance with SoftBank could boost the automaker's standing. SoftBank owns big stakes in Uber as well as in India's Ola ride service and Didi Chuxing, China's top ride-hailing firm. Michael Ronen, a managing partner for SoftBank, said Thursday the companies will make their own decisions, but Abuelsamid sees more alliances with GM coming. He foresees GM vehicles carrying passengers on the Uber, Didi or Ola networks. ""Softbank can become a conduit for GM into all these different companies that GM doesn't now have a relationship with,"" Abuelsamid said. Even though Waymo and GM now lead in autonomous vehicles, competitors such as auto electronics supplier Aptiv, well as ride-hailing service Lyft, chip maker Intel, and Ford, Renault Nissan and Germany's Diamler all have room to catch up in what could be a huge market, Abuelsamid said. Being able to produce the cars gives GM and other automakers a big advantage over tech firms that don't have their own auto factories, he said. Even with all the corporate deals, no one really knows for sure how people will get around in 10 or 15 years, Lindland said. They could embrace autonomous vehicles and the potential to eliminate the human errors that cause most crashes. Or they could distrust and reject them, Lindland said. Also, after the Uber crash, there have been calls for more supervision of autonomous vehicle testing. Currently the federal government and most states allow testing with little or no regulation. ""The last time our world was so disrupted could arguably be the internet,"" Lindland said.",2840,2844,Auto Brand,644

638,"DETROIT (AP) — A former employee hacked into computers at Tesla's Nevada battery factory, stole confidential information and combined it with falsehoods in leaks to the media, the electric car maker alleged in a federal lawsuit. The suit was filed Wednesday, three days after CEO Elon Musk warned employees of sabotage from within the company. Martin Tripp of Sparks, Nevada, admitted to Tesla investigators that he wrote software that transferred several gigabytes of data outside the company, including dozens of photographs and a video, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday. Hacking software from Tripp also was running on three computer systems of other employees ""so that the data would be exported even after he left the company and so that those individuals would be falsely implicated,"" the lawsuit alleged. A man who answered a call Wednesday at a number believed to be Tripp's said he did not know Tripp. An email message was not answered. Tripp made false claims about the information he stole, including claims that Tesla used punctured battery cells in the Model 3 electric car, and claims about the amount and value of scrap material generated by Tesla in the manufacturing process, the lawsuit alleged. Some of the claims made it into media stories about the company, but media organizations are not identified in the lawsuit. The company also alleges that Tripp sent photographs and data to unspecified third parties including financial information and battery manufacturing details. Data was combined with false information given to the media, the lawsuit said. The company says Tesla's name was damaged and the company lost business and profits due to the disclosures. On Sunday night, Musk emailed employees telling them of ""extensive and damaging sabotage"" to the company's manufacturing operating system done under false user names. He wrote that the person's motivation was that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. Musk wrote that there's a long list of organizations that ""want Tesla to die,"" including Wall Street stock short-sellers and oil and gas companies. The company was investigating whether the former employee acted alone, Musk wrote. Tesla wants monetary damages and an order to prevent Tripp from obtaining or disclosing information. It also seeks a court order to inspect his computers, electronic storage devices, email accounts and external storage accounts. Tesla would not comment on the lawsuit Wednesday. It was unclear if the company reported the alleged thefts to law enforcement. Sparks police Officer Ken Gallop said there was no record of an investigation involving Martin Tripp. Storey County Sheriff Gerald Antinoro did not immediately respond to email and telephone messages from The Associated Press. Sandra Breault, spokeswoman for the FBI in Nevada, said she was checking into the matter. Tripp joined the company in October of 2017 at the battery factory as a process technician, and had electronically signed a non-disclosure agreement, the lawsuit said.  Within a few months of his hiring, managers identified problems with his job performance, including at times being disruptive and combative with colleagues, according to the document. He was reassigned on May 17, 2018, and retaliated against the company by stealing the information, the lawsuit alleged. ____ Associated Press Writer Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York City contributed.",58,62,Auto Brand,646

650,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric vehicle producer Tesla Inc. says it will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai. The step is logical for a company that looks to China as its No. 2 market. But Tesla faces growing competition from Chinese and foreign brands that are developing dozens of electric models. And its announcement said nothing about how it will pay for the venture. Here are five things to know about Tesla's China plans: ___ WHY NOW? The announcement comes amid an increasingly bitter U.S.-Chinese tariff battle. But the Palo Alto, California-based company has been talking with the Shanghai city government since last year about a possible factory. The timing appears to be driven by Beijing's April announcement that it would end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Other automakers including General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. have been reluctant to bring electric car technology into China to avoid having to share it with potential future competitors in such joint ventures. ___ WHY CHINA? China is the No. 1 electric vehicle market, with total 2017 sales of 468,000, or more than double the U.S. level of 200,000. Beijing is promoting the technology with subsidies and a requirement for every automaker to sell electrics starting next year or buy credits from rivals that do. China already is Tesla's No. 2 market after the United States. Producing cars in China would eliminate risks from tariffs and other import controls. It also would help to develop a network of parts suppliers to support service and make Tesla more appealing to mainstream buyers. ___ WHO PAYS FOR THIS? A make-or-break question for a startup in a capital-hungry industry. Tesla lost $710 million in its latest quarter, though it says it should turn profitable soon. The company's $5 billion Nevada battery factory was financed with help from a $1.6 billion investment by battery maker Panasonic Corp. Tesla has yet to give a price tag for the Shanghai factory, but the city government said it will be the biggest foreign investment there to date. Plans call for annual production capacity to eventually reach 500,000 cars. ___ WHAT ARE TESLA'S PROSPECTS IN CHINA? Tesla's estimated 2017 sales of under 15,000 vehicles gave it a market share of under 3 percent. That gives it plenty of room to grow in a Chinese market that still is expanding, while U.S. and European demand is flat. Also, Tesla will vastly exceed Beijing's requirement that electrics make up at least 10 percent of every brand's sales next year. That might mean it earns credits it can sell to automakers that fail to meet their quotas. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE COMPETITION? Fierce and growing. Local brands including BYD Auto already sell tens of thousands of hybrid and pure-electric sedans and SUVs annually. BAIC Group's EC line, starting at $22,000, sold 13,000 units in December, nearly matching Tesla's 2017 total. GM, Volkswagen AG and other global automakers are plowing billions of dollars into developing low-cost models with local partners. They are due to hit the market starting as early as this year, well before Tesla is up and running in Shanghai.",41,45,Auto Brand,647

The National Park Service formally committed to rebuilding the island's gray wolf population after three years of study and debate, acknowledging the move was contrary to the usual hands-off approach toward designated wilderness areas.

XGR--MEDICAID WORK REQUIREMENTS-MICHIGAN LANSING, Mich. — The Republican-led Michigan Legislature on Thursday gave final approval to a bill requiring able-bodied adults in the state's Medicaid expansion program to meet work or job-related requirements, sending it to Gov. Rick Snyder for his expected signature. Starting in 2020, adults age 18 to 62 would have to show workforce engagement averaging 80 hours a month — through work, school, job or vocational training, an internship, substance abuse treatment or community service. Michigan would first seek a federal waiver to implement such requirements that have been embraced by President Donald Trump's administration.

726,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking relief from the pressures of running a publicly held company with a $72 billion buyout of the electric car maker, but he may be acquiring new headaches with his peculiar handling of the proposed deal. Almost everything about the deal is outlandish, from Musk's out-of-the-blue disclosure in a nine-word tweet to the assertion that he has lined up adequate financing to a buy a company that seems to burn through cash faster than it produces cars. If Musk can pull it off, he will have burnished his reputation as an eccentric visionary who has been compared to Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy depicted by actor Robert Downey Jr. in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But if the buyout flops, Musk and Tesla will likely face class-action lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were duped, and potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. The SEC already has opened an inquiry into the wording and method of Musk's disclosure about the deal, according to a Wednesday report in The Wall Street Journal , which cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. ""It's very obvious that Musk did not talk to any lawyers before he made his tweet,"" said John Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor and corporate-governance expert. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The SEC declined to comment. Skepticism about the legitimacy of Musk's proposed deal surfaced almost immediately after Musk dropped the bombshell on his Twitter account a few hours after the stock market opened Tuesday. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk tweeted, without elaboration or any corroboration from the company. It took about two hours before Tesla posted a Musk email to company employees on its website elaborating on his reasons for wanting to do the deal, making it clear he was serious. Before that happened, Tesla's stock had already soared. Trading in Tesla's stock was eventually halted until everyone could figure out what was going on. It wasn't until Wednesday when six directors on Tesla's nine-member board publicly acknowledged that Musk approached them last week about pursuing the financing for a buyout that would take the company off the stock market. Like Musk's tweet and email to employees, the directors' statement didn't contain details on how the buyout would be financed. The murkiness of the financing could turn into a legal mine field for Musk and Tesla, according to both Coffee and former SEC lawyer Pete Henning, now a law professor at Wayne State University. That's because Musk tweeted that the financing for the buyout had been locked up without equivocation. If there is an indication the financing is shaky, it almost certainly will expose the company and its CEO to allegations of market manipulation or fraud, Coffee and Henning said. News of the potential buyout already has stung investors known as ""short sellers"" who have long been a thorn in Musk's side. Short sellers borrow company stock and then resell the shares in the open market in a bet that they will be able to replace them at a much lower price in the near future to repay their debt. Tesla's stock surged 11 percent on Tuesday, collectively costing short sellers more than $1 billion, by some estimates. ""If (Musk's) motive was frustration with short sellers, then that could be a case of market manipulation,"" Coffee said. Those who believe Musk is carrying out a vendetta against short sellers may point to a May 4 tweet suggesting he might have something up his sleeve. ""Oh and uh short burn of the century comin (sic) soon,"" he wrote. Musk's use of Twitter to announce a huge deal also raised eyebrows, but that probably didn't violate any laws, Coffee and Henning said. The SEC has previously ruled that using social media to disclose company news is OK, as along as investors have been told that those channels may be used. Tesla disclosed in a November 2013 regulatory filing that shareholders should follow Musk's Twitter account to keep up with company news. Even though Musk has 22.3 million followers on Twitter, Tesla probably should have ensured even wider distribution of the news by simultaneously posting information on its website and filing documents with the SEC, Coffee and Henning said. Some of the fervor for a Tesla buyout faded Wednesday. Tesla's stock backtracked by more than 2 percent to close at $370.34. One of the biggest questions surrounding the buyout is Tesla's long history of losing money while it has been investing in electric car technology and ramping up production of its vehicles. The Palo Alto, California, company has only posted a quarterly profit twice in its history and has never made money during an entire calendar year, something that Musk has been trying to change by cutting costs, including recent mass layoffs that trimmed Tesla's workforce by 9 percent. Tesla lost another $717.5 million in its most recent quarter. Musk has promised to begin making money on a consistent basis starting in the third quarter, escalating the pressure that he has already publicly acknowledged has taken an immense toll on him. Just last week, he revealed he had been working 110 hours a week to deliver on short-term promises he had made to Wall Street, a load he traced to his boorish behavior toward two analysts earlier this year. ""It's very clear that he doesn't like to deal with being a CEO of a public company,"" said Gene Munster, a former stock market analyst who is now managing partner of investment fund Loup Ventures. ""I am not sure it is beating him down, but I am sure he is sick of it."" By taking Tesla private, Musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring from one quarter to the next. Buying Tesla in its entirety would cost $72 billion, based on the company's outstanding stock as of July 27. But Musk probably doesn't need that much financing because he owns a roughly 20 percent stake in the company and he is also creating a special fund that will allow existing shareholders to retain their stakes in Tesla in the private market, if they want. Munster estimates Musk will need $25 billion to $30 billion to buy out all the Tesla shareholders who want to sell at $420. Tesla also would likely need to borrow billions more to help pay for its ambitious plans of its electric vehicle line and its battery manufacturing plants. In a Wednesday research note, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated Tesla will end up taking on about $50 billion in additional debt if the company goes private. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this story.",21,25,Auto Brand,652

759,"Electric car maker Tesla Inc. burned through $739.5 million in cash last quarter, paving the way to a company record $717.5 million net loss as it cranked out more electric cars. But CEO Elon Musk pledged to post net profits in future quarters, and on a conference call, he apologized to two analysts he cut off on the company's first-quarter call. Telsa's shares jumped 9.3 percent to $328.85 in after-hours trading. The net loss more than doubled from the same quarter a year ago, and was slightly larger than the first quarter. But Tesla's cash burn in the second quarter slowed from about $1.1 billion. On the call, Musk also said he expects the company to avoid returning to the markets for capital and to be ""essentially self-funding on a go-forward basis."" Tesla would use money generated from sales to fund big projects such as an estimated $2 billion new factory in China and another plant in Europe, he said. The company also said that Model 3 gross profit margins turned slightly positive during the quarter as it worked out expensive kinks in its manufacturing system. Last quarter, Musk mistreated two analysts by calling their queries about the company's cash needs and Model 3 orders ""so dry"" and ""not cool.""  The call triggered a stock sell-off and raised questions about Musk's behavior. But on Wednesday, a contrite Musk apologized to both and said he was tired from working more than 110 hours per week last quarter. ""It's not right,"" he told an analyst from RBC Capital Markets. ""Hope you accept my apologies."" In a statement released after the markets closed Wednesday, Tesla said it expects to produce 50,000 to 55,000 Model 3s in the third quarter, an increase of at least 75 percent from the first quarter. Tesla spent millions as it reached a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of June. It now says production is rising, with the goal of 6,000 per week by the end of August. The company said it expects to reach 10,000 Model 3s per week ""sometime next year."" Cash from selling the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 but runs far higher with options, is key to holding off more borrowing and turning a profit. Tesla's cash balance fell to $2.2 billion in June, from $2.7 billion in the first quarter. Musk said he expects the company to achieve sustained quarterly net profits from now on, barring an unforeseen event, supplier problems or economic downturn. He also said that production efficiencies should rise as more Model 3s are built, and he said that he expects to make to around 750,000 vehicles in calendar year 2020. The company said it has cut back on capital spending by changing its strategy to produce the Model 3 on existing assembly lines, one in a giant tent, rather than adding all-new lines. Tesla projected total 2018 capital spending at just below $2.5 billion. That's substantially less than the 2017 level of $3.4 billion. The Palo Alto, California, company said it lost $4.22 per share from April through June as revenue grew 43 percent to just over $4 billion. Adjusted for stock-based compensation, the company lost $3.06 per share. That was worse than Wall Street estimates. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a $2.88 loss per share. Tesla also said it's working on a new version of its Autopilot semi-autonomous software that will have greater safety features. During the second quarter, Tesla laid off 9 percent of its workforce as it worked toward Musk's promise of making money. The company has never turned an annual profit and has had only two profitable quarters since becoming public in 2010. Tesla has also asked parts suppliers for refunds.",19,23,Auto Brand,653

767,"DETROIT (AP) — Two federal agencies have dispatched teams to investigate the California crash of a Tesla Model S electric car that may have been operating under its semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" system. It's the second time the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have investigated the performance of Autopilot, which keeps a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it and also can change lanes and brake automatically. The safety board sent two investigators to Culver City on Tuesday, according to spokesman Peter Knudson, while NHTSA confirmed Wednesday that it is also dispatching a special team ""to investigate the crash and assess lessons learned."" Neither agency would comment further, but it's likely they both will seek information about whether Autopilot was on and if its sensors somehow failed to see a stopped firetruck Monday on Interstate 405 in Culver City near Los Angeles. The NTSB said on Twitter that investigators will focus on driver and vehicle factors. The Tesla driver told the California Highway Patrol that he had activated Autopilot before the crash, but the highway patrol said in a news release that it was unable to verify the driver's statement at this time. The crash remains under investigation, the highway patrol said. The NTSB in September determined that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. The California investigation comes as Congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. The systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes. Tesla wouldn't say if Autopilot was working at the time of the Culver City crash, but said in a statement Monday that drivers must stay attentive when it's in use. The company would not comment on the investigation. In Monday's crash, the highway patrol said the southbound Tesla hit the rear of the Culver City firetruck, which was parked at an angle in the carpool lane while firefighters tended to a crash on the opposite side of the freeway. The truck was unoccupied at the time, and no injuries were claimed by anyone at the crash scene, the news release said. The Model S Autopilot is a level 2 on a self-driving scale of 0 to 5. Level 5 vehicles can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances. Level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways, which don't have intersections. With level 2 systems, drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary. In the Florida crash, which killed an Ohio man driving a Tesla, NTSB investigators found that the sedan's cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. Rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles being followed to prevent rear-end collisions. The NTSB re-issued previous recommendations that the government require all new cars and trucks to be equipped with technology that wirelessly transmits the vehicles' location, speed, heading and other information to other vehicles in order to prevent collisions. The NTSB also recommended that automakers develop systems to make sure drivers pay attention while using semi-autonomous systems, other than detecting the pressure of hands on the steering wheel. The driver in the Florida crash had his hands on the sedan's steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle's cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash, investigators found. Tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using Autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. If the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using Autopilot, the company has said. NHTSA, which regulates auto safety, declined last year to issue a recall or fine Tesla as a result of the crash, but it warned automakers they aren't to treat semi-autonomous cars as if they were fully self-driving. ____ Associated Press Writer Joan Lowy contributed from Washington.",99,103,Auto Brand,654

TESLA-SALES Tesla falls short on Model 3, but overall sales rise DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has again fallen short of production goals for its new Model 3 sedan. The Palo Alto, California-based company made 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. That's only a fraction of the 20,000 per month that CEO Elon Musk once promised. But the company exceeded its overall sales targets, delivering 101,312 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs in 2017, up 33 percent over 2016. Tesla says it made significant progress in reducing production bottlenecks toward the end of the fourth quarter. It now expects to be making 20,000 Model 3s per month at the end of the second quarter. More than 500,000 potential buyers on the waiting list for the Model 3, which is its first lower-cost, high-volume car. FORD-VEHICLE FIRES Ford to fix coolant leaks in vehicles recalled for fire risk DETROIT (AP) — Ford says it will repair coolant leaks that it may find in over 200,000 recalled vehicles that are at risk of catching fire. The repairs are detailed in documents posted by safety regulators in December. They come 10 months after Ford said it would only install a coolant level sensor ""with supporting hardware and software."" In March, the automaker announced that it would recall the vehicles because their 1.6-liter turbocharged engines can overheat if coolant gets low, causing oil leaks and possibly fires. Ford's March press release and recall documents did not mention leak repairs but the company now says it had planned to fix them all along. In a Dec. 13 letter to dealers, Ford said mechanics should check for leaks, and if concerns are found, they should make repairs. AMERICAN AIRLINES-CEO PAY American Airlines CEO takes in $19 million from stock sale DALLAS (AP) — The CEO of American Airlines just raised $19.2 million by selling some of his shares. Doug Parker still has stock worth $88.1 million at the current price. American disclosed the sale in a regulatory filing Wednesday. Parker cleared nearly $11.8 million after withholding taxes, according to the filing. A company spokesman said Parker exercised stock rights granted in 2008 by US Airways, which merged with American in 2009. The rights were due to expire in April. Parker stopped drawing a salary in 2015 to take more of his compensation in stock. American Airlines Group Inc. earned nearly $2.7 billion in 2016. It will report 2017 results this month. Last year Parker declared that the company would never suffer another money-losing year because of changes in the formerly boom-and-bust airline industry.

787,"Elon Musk's erratic behavior was front and center again this week as the CEO of Tesla conceded that he's overwhelmed by job stress, pushing his electric car company's stock down and bringing pressure on its board to take action. Musk's revelation, in a Thursday interview with The New York Times, came as government regulators are reportedly investigating whether his recent out-of-the-blue tweet about taking Tesla private violated disclosure requirements. Now, experts say Tesla has reached an intersection where the board must decide the direction of its leadership. Among their suggestions: Remove Musk as CEO, permanently or via a temporary leave of absence, or appoint a No. 2 executive who could act as a steadying hand. ""It's kind of bizarre,"" said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. ""It's a drama we shouldn't be watching."" Tesla presents plenty of challenges for the top executive: It routinely loses money and is burning through cash as it ramps up development of its Model 3 sedan, a less-expensive electric car it hopes appeals to the mass market. A large number of investors known as short-sellers have bet against the company. Musk has added to those pressures with lofty projections for profits and production that Tesla often fails live up to. Plus, the eccentric billionaire is the head of at least two other companies, including the rocket company Space X. Musk admitted to the Times that the past year has been the most ""difficult and painful"" of his career. The newspaper reported that during an hour-long telephone interview on Thursday, an emotional Musk acknowledged that he was working up to 120 hours a week and sometimes takes Ambien to get to sleep. Yet he said he has no plans to give up his dual role as Tesla's chairman and CEO. ""If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now,"" he told the paper. Tesla's board showed no sign of taking action on Friday. In a statement to The Associated Press, directors praised Musk's leadership, saying he had put hundreds of thousands of popular cars on the road, created tens of thousands of jobs and created significant returns for shareholders. Musk was not involved in crafting the statement. Shares of Tesla Inc. tumbled about 9 percent, closing Friday at $305.50, their lowest level since Aug. 1. For the week, the company shares lost 14 percent, or $8.5 billion in market value. Recent developments put board members in a difficult position because Musk, who entered Tesla as a major investor and built the company into a force that has changed the perception of electric cars, is the company's public identity. But Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business and law professor, said the board has a duty to shareholders. ""If the board does not get him out of this slot at a minimum on a leave of absence basis, I think the board is going to be seen by a lot of people who love the company as being derelict in their duties,"" Gordon said Friday. The board has stood behind Musk despite some bizarre behavior. For instance, in a recent tweet he labeled a diver who aided in the cave rescue of Thai soccer players as a pedophile. He later apologized. But a tweet Musk said he fired off on Aug. 7 while driving to the airport may force the board to act. In it, Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. Investors pushed Tesla's shares up 11 percent in a day, boosting its value by $6 billion. There are multiple reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the disclosure, including asking board members what they knew about Musk's plans. Experts say regulators likely are investigating if Musk was truthful in the tweet about having the financing set for the deal. Musk told the Times he stands by the tweet. At a normal company, Musk, 47, would have been replaced already, Elson said. But Tesla isn't quite normal. Elson said most of the company's directors have relationships with Musk, who owns about 20 percent of the company. ""At some point the board is going to have to assert its authority,"" Elson said. ""They're at a point where they're going to have to distance their oversight from any prior relations."" But even if Tesla's board wanted to remove Musk as CEO, it would be dangerous to do it abruptly given how much faith investors have in Musk, said David Whiston, equity strategist at Morningstar. Even with this week's losses, Tesla's market value is $52.12 billion, slightly higher than General Motors. ""Without the cult of personality around Elon, they're just a cult of personality that's burning a lot of cash."" It's clear from the interview that Musk is overworked, and Whiston said the best course may be to bring in another executive to help with day-to-day operations. The challenge would be finding someone good at the job yet willing to work at a company so dominated by one person, Whiston said. The Times cited people familiar with the situation as saying Tesla has been trying to find a No. 2 executive to help relieve some of the pressure on Musk. Tesla's board earlier this week formed a special committee to evaluate proposals to take the company private. Tesla later disclosed that Musk had talked with the Saudi Arabia government investment fund about a deal. ____ Krisher reported from Detroit. Choe reported from New York.",80,84,Auto Brand,657

U.S. retail sales rose last month by the largest amount since November, a signal to investors that consumers are very confident about the U.S. economy. Comcast is up 3 percent and Walt Disney is up 1.9 percent as the two companies battle for control of businesses being sold by Twenty-First Century Fox. Fox shares gained 1.7 percent. RETAIL SALES US retail sales climb in May by the most in 6 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. retail sales rose by the most in six months in May, as consumers spent more at home and garden stores, gas stations and restaurants. The Commerce Department says retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, the largest increase since November. Excluding the volatile gas and auto categories, sales also rose 0.8 percent. Consumers are very confident in the economic outlook, buoyed by steady job gains, an unemployment rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, and the Trump administration's tax cuts. The solid job gains have meant more Americans earning paychecks to spend. Healthier consumer spending is accelerating growth after a sluggish first quarter. Analysts forecast growth is likely to reach 4 percent in the April-June quarter, up from 2.2 percent in the first three months of the year. MORTGAGE RATES US long-term mortgage rates jump; 30-year at 4.62 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates jumped this week after two straight weeks of declines, reaching their second-highest level this year. Long-term loan rates have been running at their highest levels in seven years. And the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year and signaled that it may step up its pace of rate increases. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages was 4.62 percent, up from 4.54 percent last week. By contrast, the 30-year rate averaged 3.91 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans increased to 4.07 percent from 4.01 percent last week. IMF-US ECONOMY IMF: Tax cuts boosting US now but will hurt growth later WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund believes the U.S. economy will post solid growth this year and next, helped by a sizable boost from tax cuts. But then it says growth will slide as huge budget deficits drag growth far below the Trump administration's goals. In its annual assessment of the U.S. economy, the IMF says growth will hit 2.9 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year. Both are significant increases from last year's 2.3 percent expansion. However, after an initial boost from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package, the IMF forecasts growth will slow steadily in future years, dropping to 1.4 percent in 2023. This forecast is far below the Trump administration, which is predicting its economic program will deliver growth of 3 percent or better in coming years.

The foundation is defending its record, saying it had donated over $19 million to worthy charitable causes. It said in a statement that it had been planning to shut down for more than a year, but had been stopped from doing so because of the state's investigation.

AVA Retail CEO Atul Hirpara says Microsoft's cloud computing technology will power the retail system. Microsoft didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Amazon opened its first cashier-less Amazon Go store in Seattle this year and plans more locations in Chicago and San Francisco. Overhead cameras and other technology help keep track of customers and what they're buying. Microsoft's interest in working with retailers on similar technology was reported earlier by Reuters. RIDE-HAILING INSURANCE Startup launches insurance for Uber, Lyft passengers UNDATED (AP) — Grabbing a ride from Uber or Lyft? Now you can get an insurance policy from your phone for the ride too. Startup SURE says it has partnered with underwriter Chubb to launch a new service that allows passengers to buy accidental medical, death and dismemberment insurance coverage for the ride. While ride-hailing companies typically provide liability insurance coverage for U.S. drivers that would cover passengers in an accident, this product aims to fill in any potential gaps. The program, called RideSafe, works by connecting a customer's Uber or Lyft account to their SURE Insurance app, and once coverage is initially authorized, the passenger's ride is automatically insured. The company said Thursday that future versions of its RideSafe product will include coverage for passengers riding in autonomous vehicles used for ride-sharing.

814,"DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the California crash of a Tesla Model S electric car that may have been operating under its semi-autonomous ""Autopilot"" system. It's the second time the board has looked into a Tesla crash, and likely means that it wants information about whether Autopilot was on and if its sensors somehow failed to see a stopped firetruck Monday on Interstate 405 in Culver City near Los Angeles. The board sent two investigators to Culver City, NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said Wednesday. The NTSB said on Twitter that investigators will focus on driver and vehicle factors. The NTSB in September determined that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. The California investigation comes as Congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. The systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes. Tesla wouldn't say if Autopilot was working at the time of the Culver City crash, but said in a statement Monday that drivers must stay attentive when it's in use. The company would not comment on the investigation. In Monday's crash, the California Highway Patrol and the Culver City Fire Department confirmed the southbound Tesla hit the rear of the firetruck but could not confirm if Autopilot was operating, The Mercury News of San Jose reported. The firetruck was parked in the left emergency and carpool lane with emergency lights flashing to block a previous crash on Monday morning, Culver City Fire Battalion Chief Ken Powell told the newspaper. The Tesla suffered significant damage, but the driver showed no significant injuries, Powell said. The Model S Autopilot is a level 2 on a self-driving scale of 0 to 5. Level 5 vehicles can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances. Level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways, which don't have intersections. Autopilot keeps a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it. It also can change lanes and brake automatically. Drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary. In the Florida crash, which killed an Ohio man driving the Tesla, NTSB investigators found that the sedan's cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. Rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles being followed to prevent rear-end collisions. The NTSB re-issued previous recommendations that the government require all new cars and trucks to be equipped with technology that wirelessly transmits the vehicles' location, speed, heading and other information to other vehicles in order to prevent collisions. The NTSB also recommended that automakers develop systems to make sure drivers pay attention while using semi-autonomous systems, other than detecting the pressure of hands on the steering wheel. The driver in the Florida crash had his hands on the sedan's steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle's cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash, investigators found. Tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using Autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. If the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using Autopilot, the company has said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates auto safety, declined last year to issue a recall or fine Tesla as a result of the crash, but it warned automakers they aren't to treat semi-autonomous cars as if they were fully self-driving. ____ Associated Press Writer Joan Lowy contributed from Washington.",104,108,Auto Brand,629
855,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A former Tesla Inc. employee at the electric car maker's battery plant in Nevada is seeking at least $1 million in defamation damages after it accused him of sabotage, hacking into computers and stealing confidential information leaked to the media. Lawyers for Martin Tripp filed a counterclaim in federal court this week alleging any damages Tesla incurred were caused or contributed to by Tesla's ""own negligence, acts or omissions."" Tripp alleges that between $150 million and $200 million worth of battery module parts for Tesla's Model 3 vehicle were incorrectly handled as scrap earlier this year. He said more than 700 dented and/or punctured battery modules were not discarded and instead were being shipped or were in the process of being shipped to customers. A punctured battery could pose a fire risk. Tesla officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday. Tripp said he was recruited by Tesla, moved to Sparks, Nevada, from Wisconsin and started working at the battery factory in October 2017 as a lead process engineering technician. He was fired June 19. Tesla filed the lawsuit against Tripp on June 20, three days after Musk warned employees of sabotage from within the company. In the months prior, Tripp witnessed ""several concerning business practices"" inconsistent with Tesla's representations to investors and the general public, according to his counterclaim filed in U.S. District Court in Reno on Tuesday. Tripp said he repeatedly questioned supervisors about the large quantities of waste and scrap vehicle parts he observed ""lying haphazardly on the ground inside the Gigafactory."" But his concerns were never addressed or resolved, Tripp said. Tripp said he emailed CEO Elon Musk directly about his concerns on May 16 before Musk was scheduled to visit the factory east of Sparks that night. Later that day, Tripp said his manager asked him to forward the email he sent to Musk ""so that I can avoid getting fired tonight,"" according to the lawsuit. His counterclaim says a design engineer also told Tripp to clean up the production line area so Musk wouldn't see the mounds of scrap and waste lying on the ground, but Tripp declined to do so because he wanted Musk ""to see how the Gigafactory was actually being operated."" He said he was reassigned to a different position the following day. Tesla's original lawsuit said Tripp admitted to Tesla investigators that he wrote software that transferred several gigabytes of data outside the company, including dozens of photographs and a video, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday. Hacking software from Tripp also was running on three computer systems of other employees ""so that the data would be exported even after he left the company and so that those individuals would be falsely implicated,"" the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit said Tripp made false claims about the information he stole, including claims that Tesla used punctured battery cells in the Model 3, and claims about the amount and value of scrap material generated by Tesla's manufacturing process. Some of the claims made it into media stories about the company, but media organizations are not identified in the lawsuit. Tripp, a former aviation electronics technician in the U.S. Navy who worked two decades in the electronic and engineering industries, said in his counterclaim he ""did not sabotage Tesla or its operations"" and his actions ""were necessary, reasonable and/or privileged."" He acknowledged in the counterclaim that he had made claims about the scrap and punctured battery cells being used in Model 3 vehicles. But he said he did not direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false user names or export large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data as Musk had asserted. After he was reassigned to a new position, Tripp ""learned of and witnessed additional unnerving, dangerous and wasteful business practices,"" including employees systematically reusing parts and battery cells that had been previously discarded as waste, the suit said. The scrap problem dramatically increased in March 2018 when Tesla initiated a company-wide effort to reach its publicized goal of producing 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week, the lawsuit said. It said the production push — with an objective of making 5,000 vehicles per week by July 2018 — was known as the ""March to 2,500.""",27,31,Auto Brand,660

931,"The Model 3 is Tesla's most affordable electric car, with a promised starting price of $35,000. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have put down a $1,000 deposit for one. Almost all of them are still waiting for the chance to order. At Edmunds, however, we've purchased and taken delivery of one of the first Model 3s out. And we've driven it more than 3,000 miles so far. It's not our first Tesla; we've previously bought and conducted 18-month tests of the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV. We've sampled most other electric vehicles on the market, too. Here's what we can say so far about living with our Tesla Model 3 sedan: SERVICE AND QUALITY: A WORK IN PROCESS We're going to get this out of the way first: Tesla's scramble to increase its Model 3 production seems to have adversely affected Model 3 build quality, at least on the basis of our tiny sample of one. Body panel gaps are inconsistent, reflecting a lack of attention to detail, and this applies not only to our own car but even to Model 3s we've seen on display. After we brought ours home, we discovered it also had a cracked vanity mirror and a broken driver's seat shell. In our first six weeks, we've had to do the equivalent of a Windows PC's Ctrl-Alt-Del reboot of the all-important touchscreen about a dozen times. We've called a Tesla service center about the problems but have had difficulty getting an appointment. Drive-ups were not welcome, so our parts were ordered based on photographs alone. Weeks later, we're still waiting for word and it's hard to get answers. YOU BETTER LIKE TOUCHSCREENS The Model 3's minimalist interior is dominated by its huge central touchscreen. There are no gauges, no knobs and no switches except for door-mounted window controls. It looks clean and futuristic, but ease of use isn't as stellar. Certain controls are accessed from a couple of multi-axis roller buttons on the steering wheel. For just about everything else, you'll be reaching for the touchscreen to access wiper controls, adjust cruise control speed, and even to switch between modes on the audio system. You get used to it, but this approach increases the chances of driver distraction. The Model 3 doesn't play well with smartphones either. It lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two systems that easily integrate many of your phone's apps with the vehicle. And its USB ports cannot deliver any music, audiobook or podcast files from your phone to the audio system. The only way to listen to your media files is to stream them using Bluetooth audio. DRIVES GREAT, RANGE IS APPEALING Those issues aside, we enjoy driving the Model 3. It feels sorted and sporty when you're driving around turns, and the electric motor delivers plenty of thrust. It's dramatically quicker and more engaging to drive than other popular EVs such as the BMW i3 and the Chevrolet Bolt. That premium feel experienced in the Model S and the Model X is also present. Currently, Tesla is only building rear-wheel-drive Model 3 sedans with the expensive 310-mile long-range battery. The smaller battery and its purported 220-mile range and $35,000 price are still some months away. Edmunds paid $56,000 for its fully loaded Model 3. At first, we were ready to conclude it's not worth paying more for the big battery. In a regular gasoline car, 300 miles feels like a minimum because no one likes to stop for gas often. By contrast, you can charge an electric car at home every night, and at that point 220 miles is more than enough for daily use. But there are reasons to go big. Of course, it's an advantage for those who drive farther than average or can't charge every day. But it also has to do with charging speed at Tesla's network of Superchargers. If you've got a Model 3 with the bigger battery, you won't need to spend as much time hooked up to a Supercharger station. Because charge rates slow down as batteries get closer to full, it actually takes less time to bring a 310-mile battery up to 200 miles of range — which is likely all you'll need to get to the next station — than doing the same with the smaller 220-mile battery. The difference could amount to 15 minutes or more per stop, which could really add up during an extended road trip. EDMUNDS SAYS: Tesla does things differently, which is both a strength and a weakness. The new Model 3 sets a new standard for what an affordable electric vehicle can be. But initial problems highlight Tesla's inexperience with mass-market production. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

949,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk's elaboration on his plan to engineer a buyout of the electric car maker could get the Silicon Valley maverick into legal trouble by revealing that the deal is far more uncertain than how he initially described it in his brash tweet last week. If everything falls into place, Musk plans to buy Tesla from any existing shareholders willing to sell using money raised through Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Until his , Musk hadn't identified the source for financing a deal that analysts estimate could cost anywhere from $25 billion to $50 billion. But when he initially dropped his bombshell in , Musk stated he had ""funding secured"" to buy Tesla stock at $420 per share — 23 percent above its August 6 closing price. That assurance caused Tesla's stock to surge 11 percent in one day, boosting the company's market value by more than $6 billion to the dismay investors who had been betting Tesla's shares would decline. It now appears as if financing for the deal is far from locked up, although Musk wrote on Monday that he was encouraged to pursue the buyout in a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Discussions have continued this month, Musk wrote, while adding the caveat that the deal remained ""subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals."" That contingency contradicts the financing guarantee that Musk issued in a tweet that already has opened an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to published reports. At least two lawsuits seeking to become a class action also have been filed against Tesla, alleging Musk broke securities laws by making it sound like all the financing for the buyout had been lined up. ""'Funding secured' wasn't exactly funding secured,"" said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and former SEC lawyer. ""There are some issues here."" After reading Musk's Monday post, former SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest concluded the chances of regulators taking action against Musk are now ""quite high."" He believes Musk, who runs cutting-edge aerospace company SpaceX in addition to Tesla, opened a ""self-inflicted wound"" by announcing the buyout in last week's nine-word tweet instead of spelling out the situation like he did in Monday's post. ""What Elon Musk is trying to do with electric cars and rockets is hard enough without creating more problems for yourself with bad Twitter hygiene,"" Grundfest said. Tesla wouldn't comment on a possible SEC investigation or why it took a week for details to be released in the blog. The SEC also declined comment Monday. Six of Tesla's nine board members said last week they there are evaluating Musk's proposal, which would end Tesla's eight-year history as a public company and relieve some of the mounting pressure to reverse its long history of losses. Besides making assurances about the deal's financing, Musk also sent out another tweet that asserted the only uncertainty was whether the majority of shareholders would approve it. That statement also helped drive up Tesla's stock, irritating investors such as Mark Spiegel, whose Stanphyl Capital investment firm has been a long-time ""short seller"" of the shares. Short sellers borrow shares in a company's stock and sell them immediately on the premise they can be replaced at a lower price in the future. ""My guess is he was fooling around,"" Spiegel said of Musk's early tweets about the buyout. ""He probably was getting a good laugh out of it."" Although Musk only recently broached the possibility of buying out Tesla with its board, he wrote Monday that the Saudi Arabian fund had approached him about taking the company private multiple times during the past two years. Founded in 1971, the Public Investment Fund ranks among the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, giving it the means to buy out Tesla. It already holds about $250 billion investments around the world, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, including a $3.5 billion stake in the biggest ride-hailing service, Uber. Buying all of Tesla's stock would currently cost $72 billion, but a buyout of the Palo Alto, California, company probably wouldn't require as much money. That's because Musk owns roughly 20 percent of Tesla's stock and he envisions two-third of the company's current shareholders retaining their stakes in a newly created special fund. If only one-third of Tesla's stock is sold in a buyout offer, it would cost nearly $24 billion. Other analysts have estimated financing a Tesla buyout would cost closer to $50 billion. Investors are much more skeptical about Musk being able to pull off a buyout than they were after his first tweet about the deal. Tesla's stock crept up 92 cents Monday to close at $356.41, well below Musk's proposed bid. Even if the financing is in place, the deal might not come together because it would involve foreign interests buying at least one-third of a U.S. company that is trying to revolutionize the auto industry with its electric vehicles. The government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States would likely would review this deal because of Tesla's technology and the likelihood that a foreign country would get at least one board seat to gain some control over a U.S. company, said Jeremy Zucker, co-head of the international trade practice at Dechert LLP in Washington, D.C. Whether it's technology pertaining to longer-life batteries or technology pertaining to what's behind the dashboard in a Tesla car, ""I can see CFIUS viewing these technologies as of potential national security interest,"" he said. ____ Krisher reported from Detroit.

Tesla tore through $745.3 million in cash in the quarter, due largely to the slow production ramp-up of the Model 3 mass-market electric sedan. When questioned on the Model 3 by an analyst, Elon Musk cut him off, calling questions dry and ""not cool."" He then allowed multiple questions from a person via YouTube. RBC Capital Markets' Joseph Spak called it an ""odd conference call that lacked answers to questions on investors' minds and overshadowed earnings."" ""The general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes,"" he added in an analyst note. Shares dropped more than 7 percent in premarket trading.",0,4,Auto Brand,648
987,"Elon Musk is known for his bold predictions on electric and self-driving cars. Now his pay could depend on whether those predictions come true. Under a new all-or-nothing pay package, Musk would remain at Tesla Inc. for the next decade and see his compensation tied to ambitious growth targets. The proposal, revealed Tuesday in a regulatory filing, requires that Tesla grow in $50 billion leaps, to a staggering $650 billion market capitalization. The electric car maker, based in Palo Alto, California, is worth less than $60 billion today. Tesla must hit a series of escalating revenue and adjusted profit targets, only after which Musk would vest stock options worth 1 percent of company shares.  He would get no other guaranteed compensation. The pay package, developed over the last six months by Tesla's board, still needs the approval of Tesla shareholders, who will vote on it at a special meeting in late March. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is a Tesla board member, will recuse themselves from the vote. If the goals are reached, Tesla would be one of the biggest companies in America. The $650 billion benchmark would make Tesla the fourth-most valuable U.S. company, behind only Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. based on current valuations. It would be larger than Microsoft Corp., and would exceed the current combined valuation of the world's top eight publicly-traded auto companies. The pay scheme would also catapult Musk into the ranks of the world's richest people. Musk's stock options could be worth up to $55.8 billion if he meets the company's goals. He also would own a 28 percent stake in Tesla, which would be worth $182 billion. Forbes' current richest billionaire, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, is worth $86 billion. Musk has long had ambitious plans for Tesla. In a 2015 earnings call with analysts and media, he predicted Tesla could match Apple in total value by 2025. Musk's growth plans were laid out in a 2016 blog post he titled ""Master Plan, Part Deux."" Tesla plans to expand from electric cars and SUVs to trucks — including a semi due out in 2019 — and buses. It will continue to work on autonomous vehicle technology and plans to enter the car-sharing business, letting Tesla owners share their cars when they're not using them and running Tesla-owned fleets in cities. The company, which bought solar panel maker SolarCity Corp. in 2016, also plans to expand its solar panel and energy storage businesses. Tesla is making solar panels and roof tiles at its factory in Buffalo, New York, which will help the company blunt any impact from President Donald Trump's recent 30-percent tariff on imported solar panels and cell modules. The plans are ambitious, but that's nothing new for Tesla. Under a 2012 agreement, Musk's stock options vested only if the Tesla's market cap continued to rise in $4 billion increments. The company also had to hit matching operational milestones, including vehicle production targets and developmental milestones tied to the Model X and Model 3 programs. Tesla wound up reaching all of the market cap milestones and nine of the 10 operational milestones, falling short only of its goal to have four consecutive quarters with 30-percent gross margins. When that pay package was created, the company was worth just $3.2 billion. Its market cap at the end of last year was 17 times that amount. That's why the new goals may not be that far-fetched, says Michael Ramsey, an analyst with Gartner who follows Tesla. ""To this point, it has been dangerous to predict failure for Tesla or Elon,"" he said. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley who follows Tesla, thinks plan is partly a marketing tool as the competition for electric and autonomous vehicle talent heats up. Jonas added that Musk — who owns 21.9 percent of Tesla shares — is already ""all-in"" on the company, so he sees the incentive package as more for investor confidence than for Musk's personal benefit. In order to vest shares when milestones are reached, Musk must stay on as CEO or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer. That would give Tesla the option of hiring a different CEO. Tesla said while it doesn't currently intend for Musk to step away from the CEO role, the terms allow him to potentially focus his attention on key products and strategy. The amount of time Musk divides between Tesla and other ventures has been a concern for investors. Musk is also the founder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX and the co-founder and chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit that researches artificial intelligence. He also recently started The Boring Co., which hopes to build tunnels beneath Los Angeles and other major cities for high-speed transit. Musk has never made a salary at Tesla, which is unusual but not unheard of for a CEO. Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford didn't take a salary or bonus for five years starting in 2005 when the company's fortunes were sagging. Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison has a $1 salary but takes home millions in stock awards. And Steve Jobs took home $1 per year when he was Apple's CEO from 1997 to 2011. Tesla — which turns 15 this year — has never earned a full-year profit. It has reported only two profitable quarters since it went public in 2010. Each of the four vehicles it has made has faced significant delays and production problems. Its newest vehicle, the lower-cost Model 3 sedan, is no exception. Musk initially said Tesla would be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by the end of 2017, but he recently pushed that goal to the end of the second quarter. That hasn't dimmed investors' appetite for Tesla's stock. Tesla shares were up less than 1 percent to $352 in afternoon trading. They've risen around 40 percent over the last year. ___ Durbin reported from Detroit.",205,209,Auto Brand,665
994,NEW YORK (AP) — Shares of Tesla are down sharply after a report that the company asked suppliers for refunds to help it turn a profit. A memo provided to The Wall Street Journal shows Tesla asked a supplier to return what it calls a meaningful amount of money on its payments since 2016. The memo said all suppliers were being asked to help the company become profitable. The request raises more questions about Tesla's cash position. The 15-year-old company has never reported an annual profit. It is spending about $1 billion a quarter as it ramps up manufacturing of its Model 3 sedan. It had $2.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. Tesla stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trading Monday.,26,30,Auto Brand,622

A first group of Tesla technicians is set to graduate next week from a 12-week training program at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte. The company said a second group is nearing the end of classes at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, California. Courses focus on skills specific to electric vehicles such as battery architecture and charging technology, and particularly servicing Tesla vehicles.

1042,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. is laying off about 3,600 workers mainly from its salaried ranks as it slashes costs in an effort to deliver on CEO Elon Musk's promise to turn a profit in the second half of the year. In an email to workers on Tuesday, Musk said the cuts amount to about 9 percent of the company's workforce of 40,000. Tesla would not say how much money the layoffs would save, but said no factory workers would be affected as the company continues to ramp up production of its lower-priced Model 3 compact car. The move is part of an organizational restructuring that Musk announced earlier in the year. ""Tesla has grown and evolved rapidly over the past several years, which has resulted in some duplication of roles and some job functions that, while they made sense in the past, are difficult to justify today,"" Musk wrote in the email. He thanked departing employees for their hard work and said Tesla is providing ""significant salary and stock vesting"" to those being let go, based on their length of service. Tesla has not made an annual profit in its 15 years of doing business, and it has posted only two quarterly net profits. At the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said he expected the Palo Alto, California, company to post a quarterly profit during the July-September period. For nearly all of its history, Tesla has put up losses while investing heavily in technology, manufacturing plants and an extensive car-charging network. It's not the first time Tesla has laid off workers. The company let go of 400 to 700 workers last fall after completing annual performance reviews, and it laid off a small number of workers back in 2008. Musk wrote in the email that the company will never achieve its mission to help move the world to cleaner energy ""unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable."" The company is making the move now so it never has to do it again, he wrote. Tesla still has a significant need for production workers as it tries to reach Model 3 manufacturing targets, he wrote in the email. The layoffs come in engineering, sales and other front-office functions, but the company says the remaining workforce is large enough to accomplish Musk's lofty goals of rolling out a semi, pickup truck and a new SUV in the coming years. Tesla shares rose 2.5 percent to $340.34 in afternoon trading, after reaching as high as $354.97 around noon. Musk also announced that the company's solar panel unit has decided to end its agreement to sell via Home Depot stores so it can focus on sales in Tesla's company stores and online. A majority of Tesla employees working at Home Depot will get offers to work in Tesla's own stores. Consumer Edge Research Analyst James Albertine wrote in a note to investors that he views the moves ""as a positive in helping Tesla track toward profitability later this year."" He wrote that reaching Musk's Model 3 production goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of June is still the primary driver of profitability. ""A focus on 'getting lean' is a positive with respect to Tesla's guidance for achieving consolidated profitability in 2018, in our view,"" he wrote. The Model 3 starts at $35,000, but lower-priced configurations are not available yet. It can easily top $50,000 with options.",34,38,Auto Brand,667
1043,"DETROIT (AP) — It's virtually impossible to buy a car these days that comes with a set of shot glasses. The 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham, though, included not just a set of shot glasses but Arpege perfume, Fleetwood cigarettes and a powder compact in the purchase price of $13,074 — about three times the cost of a regular Cadillac and pricier than a new home in an upscale area at the time. Only 400 were built. Today the vanity kit alone is worth as much as the car. This is but one specimen of perfection at a nondescript location in Sterling Heights. A temperature-controlled showroom displays 165 vintage cars at a time of 700 owned. Each visit to the rotating exhibit offers a glimpse of something different. Designs range from 1902 to present, concept cars and road tested. Many vehicles have been purchased, reclaimed and restored after collectors died. A purple 1967 Pontiac GTO hidden under the sand of the Arizona desert was dug up, cleaned and refurbished. The General Motors Heritage Center protects one of the greatest vintage car collections in the world, curated and maintained by the Detroit-based automaker. It is also home to GM's historical literature and artifacts. For car collectors, the site is a jewelry box filled with precious gems. These include the most celebrated cars of our time, and those featured in Beach Boys songs and driven by Elvis Presley on screen. The unpublicized collection is somehow attracting visitors recently from Sweden, Australia, Poland, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, the reported. They're driving to the building just off Mound Road, between 15 Mile and 16 Mile roads. The dreary route is riddled with potholes. There's no big sign directing anyone to anything in particular. The setting is an industrial park. Viewing is by appointment only. Callers schedule visits months and years in advance. While access at the locked front door doesn't require a secret handshake, it probably should. ""Holy smokes. I've never seen anything like this,"" said Robert Wall, 89, a Detroit native who has attended every Motor City auto show since 1937. ""I had no idea this existed. I couldn't have imagined this in my wildest dreams. I could stay forever."" He was rationed to 90 minutes. To those who know nothing about cars or think they care little, well, there are simply no words. This is a design mecca. Everything is labeled with historical explanation and auto industry impact. Over there is a 1951 LeSabre and a 1931 Cadillac V-16 and Corvettes from 1953 to 2005 and the very first Oldmobile Toronado ever made. Plus, the Firebird I, II and III gas turbine concept cars from the 1950s. All this chatter about electric vehicles and innovation? Check out the enormous battery under the hood of the 1966 Electrovair II Experimental car. GM may be considered a front-runner on electrification today, but it's clear the institutional knowledge spans decades, said Greg Wallace, who has helped develop the collection over the past two decades as manager. (On this day, he was filming segments for the History Channel.) ""The collection tells a story of the history of the automobile and our fascination with car culture,"" said Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty, the world's leading classic car insurer based in Traverse City. ""You're actually able to study the thinking and innovation of the company and see how things were applied or not applied to production vehicles."" Oh, and those Smart micro cars that tuck neatly into puny parking spaces in New York and San Francisco? Don't miss their predecessor, a 1969 512 Electric Experimental. Visitors learn that the word ""cranky"" comes from drivers in the early 1900s having a bad day crank-starting the car. The crankshaft would kick back and break a thumb or a wrist and, on occasion, come out of the crank hold and hit the operator in the head, Wallace said. Vehicles from the 1900s have headlight covers that open to reveal a lantern wick inside. Steering wheels in 1912 were on the right, not left. (Ford put so many steering wheels on the left side that eventually everyone else did too, Wallace pointed out.) Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, said classic car junkies can't help but savor trips to the Heritage collection. ""All of the significant show cars are there — the Y-Job, the Le Sabre, the Firebirds — as well as the company's iconic production cars — the Tri-Five Chevys, the 1959 Cadillac, the split-window 1963 Corvette, the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am Special Edition,"" he said. ""But there's also a strong collection of technologically significant cars — not as flashy but equally important."" Cars like the 1912 Cadillac, the first auto with an electric starter; the 1915 Cadillac, with the first mass-produced V8 engine; and the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, the first front-wheel drive American car since the 1930s. The first electric starter meant people of smaller stature, who lacked upper body strength, could start cars for the first time on their own. And the V8 engine created a new industry standard for more powerful vehicles. ""I admire GM for saving examples of less-than-stellar products, too,"" Anderson said. ""One of my favorite vehicles at the GM Heritage Center is a 1976 Chevrolet Chevette — no one's idea of a collector car today, but one that sold in the millions in its time. Cars like the Corvette made GM's image, but cars like the Chevette made its bottom line."" In the beginning, the goal was just to try and preserve history, Wallace said. ""I had no idea it would turn into what it has,"" he explained. ""Once history is gone, it's gone. I wanted to make sure we could tell our story down the road."" Now visitors can track a nation's highs and lows, changes and progress. ""You can see prosperity and optimism through the '40s, then where the industry was in hiatus from '42 to '47 for the war and then it all starts back up again. Wealth and prosperity was growing,"" said Mike Simcoe, vice president of global design for GM. ""You see the industry wrestling with the change of fuel economy targets in the late '70s, with more stringent safety requirements, crash requirements, and the way some of those regulations were applied and how it impacted the structure of the vehicles. The '80s were an odd period, in fashion and style generally. I can say this in confidence, I have photos of myself."" Some visitors whisper their desire to see the GM collection turned into a public exhibit on the Detroit riverfront one day, a stone's throw from the company's world headquarters in the Renaissance Center. ""It would be amazing,"" said Eddie Alterman, editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine. ""At the height of its power, GM was seen as the trailblazer — the Tesla of its time. And the company continues as an innovation leader in ways people don't fully appreciate."" The vehicles are so carefully maintained and protected that there's no plan to make the exhibit public, though it can be reserved for group tours, conferences and special events. Despite being a secret, 300-plus events and tours were held in 2017. Near the door of the showroom, there's a small case with photos of non-auto engineering accomplishments that include the B-25 Bomber, P-51 Mustang Fighter and FM-2 Wildcat Fighter; diesel-electric freight locomotives that essentially ended the use of steam; and a 1952 mechanical heart pump that made possible the world's first open heart surgery, developed and donated by GM at no cost to the heart surgery team at Wayne State University in Detroit. ""Mind-boggling,"" Wall said, reading the display. ""Just mind-boggling."" ___ Information from: Detroit Free Press, An AP Member Exchange shared by the Detroit Free Press.",6715,6719,Auto Brand,668

1060,"MUNICH (AP) — Some of the biggest automakers in Europe are joining forces to build a highway network of fast-charging stations they hope will boost sales of electric vehicles. The idea is to let drivers plug in, charge in minutes instead of hours, and speed off again — from Norway to southern Italy, and Portugal to Poland. Much is at stake for the automakers, which include Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Ford. Their joint venture, Munich-based Ionity, is pushing to roll out its network in time to service the next generation of battery-only cars coming on the market starting next year from Volkswagen's Porsche and Audi, BMW and Daimler. They're aiming to win back some of the market share for electric luxury car sales lost to Tesla, which has its own, proprietary fast-charging network.",731,735,Auto Brand,671
1090,"If you're in the market for a new SUV, it's important to know not only what's available now but also what's coming. Here are six SUVs going on sale in the next several months that we at Edmunds think are worth waiting for. Why these six? One thing they have in common is the latest technology. On top of updated infotainment systems, every vehicle on this list offers a full suite of advanced safety features. Some have a few more tricks up their sleeves, and all offer something unique in the hopes of winning your hard-earned dollar. VOLVO XC40 Volvo's newest SUV is the subcompact 2019 XC40. It offers plenty of safety and technology features, and it's been built to make the most of its available space. Some useful highlights include an integrated trash bin, a hook for holding takeout food, and door pockets that can fit a 15-inch laptop. Acceleration comes from a punchy 248-horsepower turbocharged engine. And a hybrid model is coming. Volvo is also using the XC40 to pioneer its new subscription-based Care By Volvo service. Similar to a pay-as-you-go phone plan, consumers pay a fixed monthly fee to get the XC40 with nearly everything covered, including insurance, and the option to change to another vehicle in as little as one year. The XC40 Momentum — the only trim available at launch — comes with a price tag of $35,200. Future base pricing starts at $33,200. HYUNDAI SANTA FE AND SANTA FE XL We have high hopes for the redesigned 2019 Santa Fe. The lineup includes a two-row compact SUV and the larger three-row Santa Fe XL. Both look modern and upscale inside and out and should be very competitive with SUVs from Honda and Toyota. Three engines will be available, including a 232-horsepower turbocharged gas engine and a 200-horsepower turbodiesel. The latter, along with optional load-leveling suspension, should make the Santa Fe a capable tow vehicle. The Santa Fe also offers a new Safe Exit Assist feature that can lock a door if it senses a passenger is about to swing it open in the path of an oncoming vehicle. Pricing on either SUV is not yet available. The Santa Fe Sport currently goes for about $25,000 while the Santa Fe is $31,000. ACURA RDX The newest generation of Acura's compact luxury SUV looks to be its biggest step forward. The 2019 RDX will feature Acura's agility-enhancing all-wheel-drive system, a new look, lots of interior storage space and a nicely appointed cabin. Acura has also replaced the RDX's dual-screen infotainment setup, which was clunky and outdated. The new system uses a clean, high-definition screen and a touchpad controller. Further equipped with luxury features, such as a panoramic sunroof, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a head-up display and a premium audio system, the RDX should be one of the best new Acuras in years. No pricing information is available for the newest Acura RDX, but the current generation starts at $36,000. SUBARU ASCENT Those in need of a capable family hauler will have a new choice to consider: the 2019 Ascent. Subaru's three-row SUV is packed with features to keep both driver and passengers happy. With up to eight USB ports available, the Ascent can keep everyone's devices charged. Three-zone climate control and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are all standard, as are traffic-adaptive cruise control and a frontal collision mitigation system. With a $31,995 base price, the Ascent can also be optioned with lots of luxury-oriented comforts, including cooled front seats, second-row sunshades, and a premium Harman Kardon sound system. With 260 horsepower, standard all-wheel drive and a 5,000-pound towing capacity, the Ascent should make a compelling midsize choice. LEXUS UX Another new subcompact luxury SUV, the 2019 Lexus UX takes a different approach to the segment with its overstated, aggressive styling. Inside, you'll find a sleek design reminiscent of Lexus' flagship LC 500 coupe, as well as a digital gauge cluster. Both a 168-horsepower gasoline engine and a 176-horsepower hybrid with all-wheel drive will be available. The UX is a high-tech little SUV. It can use GPS information to adjust the vehicle to road conditions and maximize fuel efficiency. And it can be outfitted with an adaptive suspension to enhance ride comfort and handling precision. Pricing is not yet available. JAGUAR I-PACE If you wanted an all-electric SUV, your only choice up until now was the Tesla Model X. But Jaguar will give you another option with its 2019 I-Pace. The I-Pace should provide about 240 miles of driving range on a fully charged battery and yield a sports-car-worthy 0-60 mph sprint of about 4.5 seconds. The I-Pace doesn't offer a lot of cargo space, but it comes with a luxuriously appointed interior and a sleek-looking tech interface. Before incentives, the I-Pace should come in around $70,000, which also makes its price tag smaller than the Model X's. EDMUNDS SAYS: Though there's no shortage of good SUVs available now, it's worth taking note of new models hitting dealer showrooms this summer and fall. One could end up suiting your needs the best. ____ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds. Will Kaufman is an associate staff writer at Edmunds.

1101,"TORONTO (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Motors said Thursday it is suing Ontario's new government, claiming it was treated unfairly in the cancellation of a program providing rebates to residents who bought electric vehicles. Tesla Motors Canada said in court documents that the decision by Premier Doug Ford's conservative government to cancel the program in July left hundreds of customers ineligible for rebates they expected to get when they ordered their vehicles. It claims Tesla was singled out. In July, the government said the rebates would be honored for vehicles ordered through a dealership if they are delivered and registered by Sept. 10, but Tesla sells vehicles directly to customers rather than through a dealership. ""The decision has already inflicted substantial harm on Tesla Canada in the form of lost sales and the creation of an impression among Ontarians that Tesla Canada may be singled out for future arbitrary treatment under the law,"" the company's statement said. The Ontario Transportation Ministry said Thursday that it would not comment on the situation because the matter is before the court. Customers who have been waiting for Tesla Model 3 cars to be delivered say the Ontario government's move has them rethinking their purchase. Toronto teacher Kurtis Evans said he was planning to sell his current vehicle — and was counting on receiving the maximum rebate of 14,000 Canadian dollars ($10,068) to be able to afford the Tesla he ordered in June for 71,000 Canadian dollars ($60,000). ""My wife and I are still not sure if we are going to take delivery without the rebate ... we are not millionaires,"" he said, adding that he fears losing a non-refundable deposit if he cancels the order.",34,38,Auto Brand,674
1122,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker, according to media reports. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors, . The newspaper cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter after Fox Business News reported the SEC's move. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with revealing that he had lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell. The subpoena signals regulators have now opened a formal investigation into whether Musk was telling the truth in his tweet about have financing locked up for a deal that analysts have estimated would require $25 billion to $50 billion. Under a scenario sketched out by Musk , the deal would cost at the lower end of those estimates. Musk also revealed in the same post that he had been talking to Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund about providing the money for a buyout that would end Tesla's eight-year history as a publicly held company, but he added that the financing was still contingent on due diligence. Corporate governance experts say that caveat shows the financing of the deal isn't finalized, as Musk initially indicated, a contradiction that could be used to prove he deliberately misled investors with his tweet. After Musk dropped his bombshell, Tesla's stock surged 11 percent in one day, damaging a class of investors who had been betting the company's shares would decline. Musk has had a long-running battle with that group of investors, who are known as ""short sellers"" in Wall Street's parlance. Tesla's stock has backtracked since that one-day pop last week, but at least two lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of shareholders alleging Musk broke the law with his tweet, and now the SEC is taking a closer look too.

1135,"DETROIT (AP) — Hyundai and Volkswagen each say they're partnering with a U.S. autonomous vehicle tech firm led by former executives from Google, Tesla and Uber. The companies on Thursday announced partnerships with Aurora Innovation, started last year by ex-Google autonomous car chief Chris Urmson and others. VW says its collaboration will help bring self-driving cars quickly to roads worldwide, while autonomous Hyundais are expected to be in the market by 2021. The partnerships are the latest in a string of tie-ups between traditional auto companies and tech firms as they race to be first with self-driving vehicles. Aurora is based in Pittsburgh and Palo Alto, California. It was started last year by Urmson, former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell. Terms of each partnership were not released, but Urmson, who is Aurora's CEO, said the startup will make a profit by helping Hyundai and VW develop safe autonomous vehicles. In an interview with The Associated Press, Urmson said he isn't sure exactly where money will be made in autonomous vehicles. It could be from developing sophisticated sensing and guidance systems, manufacturing vehicles or providing transportation as a service. ""The way the economics play out over time is still far from foregone,"" he said. ""We still don't know which of these pieces will be dominant or if they will find a happy equilibrium."" Urmson left Alphabet Inc.'s Google in 2016 after more than seven years of work on its autonomous vehicles. At Tesla Inc., Anderson led development of the company's semi-autonomous Autopilot system after its initial release, and he led development of the Model X SUV, according to Aurora's website. Bagnell was a founding member of Uber Technologies Inc.'s Advanced Technology Center that's working on autonomous cars in Pittsburgh. Germany-based Volkswagen AG, which produces about 10 million vehicles annually, hopes the tie-up will bring autonomous vehicle technology to all of its brands. The company says it has been working with Aurora for the past six months, integrating its sensors, hardware and software into VW vehicles. Hyundai Motor Co. said the partnership with Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to market that can operate without human input in most conditions. The partnership has yet to say how its first batch of self-driving vehicles will be used, but analysts expect they will likely be for commercial use, such as self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services, rather than for sales to individual consumers. General Motors said in November that its self-driving vehicles will carry passengers and deliver goods in big cities by 2019. Hyundai earlier joined with Cisco Systems Inc. and Baidu Inc. to collaborate on internet-connected cars. It has also set up a $45 million fund with South Korea's SK Telecom and Hanwha Asset Management to invest in artificial intelligence startups worldwide. The South Korean automaker plans to share more details of its project with Aurora during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, where it will also unveil the brand name of a new fuel-cell SUV that will be tested for self-driving technology. The company plans to show off some of its autonomous driving cars during the Winter Olympics Game next month in Pyeongchang, South Korea. ___ Youkyung Lee contributed to this report from Seoul.",145,149,Auto Brand,676

1210,"A Tesla SUV using the company's semi-autonomous Autopilot driving system accelerated just before crashing into a California freeway barrier, killing its driver, federal investigators have determined. The National Transportation Safety Board, in a preliminary report on the March 23 crash, also said that data shows the Model X SUV did not brake or try to steer around the barrier in the three seconds before the crash in Silicon Valley. The NTSB says it now will examine the cause of the crash. Tesla wouldn't say if the system performed as designed. A spokeswoman referred to a company blog saying that a Tesla with Autopilot is far safer than vehicles without it. The blog says Autopilot does not prevent all crashes but makes them less likely. The crash on U.S. 101 killed the driver, Walter Huang, 38, an Apple software engineer. In the report released Thursday, the NTSB said the SUV was operating with traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer lane-keeping assistance engaged at the time of the crash. The cruise control maintains a set distance between the cars and traffic in front of them. The SUV also was equipped with automatic emergency braking, which is always on in Tesla vehicles unless customers deactivate it by taking several steps on the vehicle touch screen. According to the report, during the 60 seconds before the crash, Huang's hands were detected on the steering wheel three times for a total of 34 seconds. But for the last six seconds, hands were not detected on the steering wheel. Eight seconds before the crash, the SUV was following a vehicle and traveling about 65 mph. A second later, the SUV began a ""left steering movement"" while still following the other vehicle. Four seconds before the crash the Tesla wasn't following a vehicle any more. A second later it accelerated from 62 mph to 70.8 mph ""with no pre-crash braking or evasive steering movement detected,"" the report said. When the SUV moved to the left, it entered a triangular ""gore area"" that is marked with white lines and divides the freeway lanes from an exit ramp. Then it hit the barrier, which was equipped with an accordion-like device to absorb impact in a crash. But that device had been damaged in a previous crash on March 12. It likely will take more than a year to determine what caused the crash, NTSB spokesman Christopher O'Neil said Thursday. Among other factors, investigators are trying to determine how the car's camera, radar and ultrasonic sensors were working and what they were tracking. ""The focus isn't Tesla's technology,"" he said. ""The focus is on what led to this crash and how do we prevent it from happening again."" Tesla's system may have a problem spotting or stopping for stationary objects. Federal agencies are investigating two other crashes in which Teslas ran into stopped fire department vehicles. In January, a Tesla Model S sedan that may have been using Autopilot hit a parked firetruck on Interstate 405 near Los Angeles. The driver told authorities the Autopilot was working at the time. The firetruck was unoccupied and no injuries were claimed by anyone at the crash scene, authorities said. NTSB, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a regulatory agency that can seek recalls and fine automakers, are investigating that crash. NHTSA also is looking into a May 11 crash involving a Tesla Model S near Salt Lake City. Autopilot was in use when the car hit a stopped fire department truck. The driver of the vehicle told police she thought the Tesla's automatic emergency braking system would detect traffic and stop before the car hit another vehicle. A Tesla spokeswoman pointed to passages in the company's owners' manual warning that automatic emergency braking is designed to reduce severity of a crash and isn't designed to avoid a collision. It also may not work all the time, the manual say. ""It is the driver's responsibility to drive safely and remain in control of the vehicle at all times,"" it says. ""Never depend on Automatic Emergency Braking to avoid or reduce the impact of a collision."" In the Mountain View-area crash, the NTSB also is investigating fires that broke out in the SUV's batteries after the crash.

The upshot is while they could save your life, the systems can fail under many circumstances.

1248,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — Starting next month, Nissan Motor Co. is testing on regular roads what it calls ""a robo-vehicle mobility service."" Called Easy Ride, it uses a cell-phone app to book semi-autonomous driven rides. But Easy Ride won't necessarily be easy if poor internet connections mean it won't work at all. Nissan says that feedback from the 300 people who have signed up to try out Easy Ride will be used to fine-tune the app. The Japanese automaker hopes to roll it out as a commercial service in the early 2020s. Details, including pricing, are undecided. The service was developed in a partnership, which began last year, with Japanese mobile game provider DeNA Co. DeNA has been working on driverless bus and delivery services in Japan. For now, Easy Ride will be limited to a 4.5-kilometer (2.8-mile) course that starts from Nissan headquarters and winds through a shopping mall area in this Japanese port city. The app is only in Japanese, but there are plans to offer it in several languages for tourists and other travelers. Like other autonomous drive technology, the Easy Ride vehicle is packed with cameras, sensors and radars to recognize pedestrians, intersections, traffic lights and other vehicles. It's still only driverless in principle, though, since Japanese law doesn't allow totally driverless vehicles. So a human driver in a no-hands position sits behind the steering wheel. The system isn't flawless, with human intervention sometimes needed to avoid a crash, according to Nissan. It's just one of several such kinds of technology being worked on around the world, such as Google's Waymo and Tesla's Autopilot. Just about all the major automakers, including Mercedes and Toyota, are working on such technologies. Nissan has been among the most aggressive. Although opinion is divided on the projection that as many as 10 million driverless cars will be on roads by 2020, everyone agrees the technology is going to grow. ""I think the potential is quite large in the long term, especially in large cities such as Tokyo or Boston, where there is a need for point-to-point transit but little incentive to own cars,"" said Nicholas Evans, an assistant professor at UMass Lowell. However, he cautioned, ""In introducing technology, all it takes is for a couple of high-profile accidents for consumers to turn against manufacturers. ""It's in the self-interest of manufacturers for rigorous testing and public input on this new kind of technology,"" said Evans, who studies the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies such as drones and self-driving vehicles. For Easy Ride, users first download a special app on their cellphones. After logging on, voice recognition is used to set a destination, and the date and time for when the ride picks you up at one of four possible spots in Yokohama. Once in the back seat of the vehicle, a display shows your route on a digital map. It also recommends events such as concerts, historical landmarks, restaurants and other places to visit, which pop up as photos and text on the display. The service also includes coupons that can be downloaded and used at those spots. Easy Ride is still experimental, but future uses Nissan envisions include parents using it to pick up their children and tourists using it to easily find their way around. Some glitches remain. In a recent demonstration for reporters, the app had problems launching because of a poor net connection at Nissan headquarters. When a reporter said, ""I want to eat a burger,"" it successfully recommended several nearby joints. But it was not able to find the nearest New Balance store, or any other place to buy sneakers. ____ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",1625,1629,Auto Brand,681

Sales of electric and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 126 percent over a year earlier. Through May, sales of electrics and hybrids rose 142 percent to 328,000. Beijing has spent heavily to transform China into the world's biggest electric car market and is preparing to enforce sales quotas to press global automakers to speed up development. The Finance Ministry says auto import duties will be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent on most vehicles, effective July 1. That followed pledges to buy more U.S. goods and end restrictions on foreign ownership in the industry. Ford Motor Co. responded by announcing a cut in prices of imported models. But industry analysts say automakers including Ford, General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG are likely to gain little in sales, because most of their vehicles sold in China are produced in local factories. The tariff cut is likely to benefit high-end European and Japanese brands such as BMW AG, VW's Audi unit and Toyota Motor Co.'s Lexus that import more of their vehicles, as well as Tesla, the electric car brand that has no China factory, according to industry analysts. — Nissan Motor Co. sales rose 14.3 percent to 128,059.

1268,"Electric car maker Tesla Inc. has delivered on its CEO's promise to build a lower-priced car at a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of June. CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to company employees Sunday praising them for producing 5,000 Model 3s, a compact car that's designed to shift Tesla from a niche manufacturer to a mainstream automaker. Musk also said the company had cranked out a combined 2,000 of Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles, bringing overall production to a record 7,000 for the week. ""We did it!"" Musk wrote. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team."" The e-mail was reported by the website Electrek, and the company confirmed its authenticity. Last summer, when the first Model 3s began rolling off the assembly line, Musk promised to build 5,000 per week by December and 10,000 per week in 2018. But he also warned at the time that Tesla was entering at least six months of ""manufacturing hell"" as it tried to hit the targets. Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at the market research firm AutoPacific Inc., wasn't impressed. ""Reaching it is one thing,"" Sullivan said. ""Consistently producing 5,000 per week with outstanding quality is another. I don't think producing 5,000 once is anything to get excited about until it's repeatable."" Model 3 sales are critical to Tesla's future. The company has never posted a full-year profit, and it burned through more than $1 billion in cash in the first quarter. Wall Street investors, who have pushed the company's stock beyond $340 per share, are growing impatient with the losses. Moody's Investor Service downgraded Tesla's debt into junk territory back in March, warning that Tesla won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla said cash from Model 3 sales will pay the bills and drive profits. The company reached 5,000 per week as Musk spent many nights inside the Fremont, California, factory that once belonged to a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota. To quickly put another assembly line in place, Tesla built a large tent at the factory site. Musk told investors on a first-quarter earnings conference call that the company relied too heavily on automation. It had to hire more people to work at the factory. Tesla said in April that it had about 450,000 orders for the Model 3. But some could be getting antsy, especially those who want a price closer to the base of $35,000. Currently Tesla is selling only Model 3s that cost $49,000 to in excess of $70,000. Many have been waiting since March of 2016, when Tesla began taking orders with a $1,000 refundable deposit. The company also may have to deal with some safety issues. Investigators from two federal agencies are looking into five crashes of its vehicles, some involving the semi-autonomous Autopilot system or post-crash battery fires that have been difficult to extinguish. But regardless of those issues, Musk was in a celebratory mood Sunday. ""I think we just became a real car company,"" he wrote. ___ AP Business Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this story.",19,23,Auto Brand,683
1282,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking relief from the pressures of running a publicly held company with a $72 billion buyout of the electric car maker, but he may be acquiring new headaches with his peculiar handling of the proposed deal. Almost everything about the deal is outlandish, from Musk's out-of-the-blue disclosure in a to the assertion that he has lined up adequate financing to a buy a company that seems to burn through cash faster than it produces cars. If Musk can pull it off, he will have burnished his reputation as an eccentric visionary who has been compared to Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy depicted by actor Robert Downey Jr. in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But if the buyout flops, Musk and Tesla will likely face class-action lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were duped, and potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. The SEC already has opened an inquiry into the wording and method of Musk's disclosure about the deal, , which cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. ""It's very obvious that Musk did not talk to any lawyers before he made his tweet,"" said John Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor and corporate-governance expert. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The SEC declined to comment. Skepticism about the legitimacy of Musk's proposed deal surfaced almost immediately after Musk dropped the bombshell on his Twitter account a few hours after the stock market opened Tuesday. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk tweeted, without elaboration or any corroboration from the company. It took about two hours before Tesla posted to company employees on its website elaborating on his reasons for wanting to do the deal, making it clear he was serious. Before that happened, Tesla's stock had already soared. Trading in Tesla's stock was eventually halted until everyone could figure out what was going on. It wasn't until Wednesday when six directors on Tesla's nine-member board publicly acknowledged that Musk approached them last week about pursuing the financing for a buyout that would take the company off the stock market. Like Musk's tweet and email to employees, the directors' statement didn't contain details on how the buyout would be financed. The murkiness of the financing could turn into a legal mine field for Musk and Tesla, according to both Coffee and former SEC lawyer Pete Henning, now a law professor at Wayne State University. That's because Musk tweeted that the financing for the buyout had been locked up without equivocation. If there is an indication the financing is shaky, it almost certainly will expose the company and its CEO to allegations of market manipulation or fraud, Coffee and Henning said. News of the potential buyout already has stung investors known as ""short sellers"" who have long been a thorn in Musk's side. Short sellers borrow company stock and then resell the shares in the open market in a bet that they will be able to replace them at a much lower price in the near future to repay their debt. Tesla's stock surged 11 percent on Tuesday, collectively costing short sellers more than $1 billion, by some estimates. ""If (Musk's) motive was frustration with short sellers, then that could be a case of market manipulation,"" Coffee said. Those who believe Musk is carrying out a vendetta against short sellers may point to suggesting he might have something up his sleeve. ""Oh and uh short burn of the century comin (sic) soon,"" he wrote. Musk's use of Twitter to announce a huge deal also raised eyebrows, but that probably didn't violate any laws, Coffee and Henning said. The SEC has previously ruled that using social media to disclose company news is OK, as along as investors have been told that those channels may be used. Tesla disclosed in a that shareholders should follow Musk's Twitter account to keep up with company news. Even though Musk has 22.3 million followers on Twitter, Tesla probably should have ensured even wider distribution of the news by simultaneously posting information on its website and filing documents with the SEC, Coffee and Henning said. Some of the fervor for a Tesla buyout faded Wednesday. Tesla's stock backtracked by more than 2 percent to close at $370.34. One of the biggest questions surrounding the buyout is Tesla's long history of losing money while it has been investing in electric car technology and ramping up production of its vehicles. The Palo Alto, California, company has only posted a quarterly profit twice in its history and has never made money during an entire calendar year, something that Musk has been trying to change by cutting costs, including recent mass layoffs that trimmed Tesla's workforce by 9 percent. Tesla lost another $717.5 million in its most recent quarter. Musk has promised to begin making money on a consistent basis starting in the third quarter, escalating the pressure that he has already publicly acknowledged has taken an immense toll on him. Just last week, to deliver on short-term promises he had made to Wall Street, a load he traced to his boorish behavior toward two analysts earlier this year. ""It's very clear that he doesn't like to deal with being a CEO of a public company,"" said Gene Munster, a former stock market analyst who is now managing partner of investment fund Loup Ventures. ""I am not sure it is beating him down, but I am sure he is sick of it."" By taking Tesla private, Musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring from one quarter to the next. Buying Tesla in its entirety would cost $72 billion, based on the company's outstanding stock as of July 27. But Musk probably doesn't need that much financing because he owns a roughly 20 percent stake in the company and he is also creating a special fund that will allow existing shareholders to retain their stakes in Tesla in the private market, if they want. Munster estimates Musk will need $25 billion to $30 billion to buy out all the Tesla shareholders who want to sell at $420. Tesla also would likely need to borrow billions more to help pay for its ambitious plans of its electric vehicle line and its battery manufacturing plants. In a Wednesday research note, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated Tesla will end up taking on about $50 billion in additional debt if the company goes private. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this story.",21,25,Auto Brand,684

The Commerce Department says that housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million from 1.34 million in May. Housing starts plunged 35.8 percent in the Midwest and declined less severely in the Northeast, South and West. Still, the drop-off might only reflect the volatile nature of the monthly report. A steady job market and a shortage of existing homes for sale have bolstered housing starts for the first half of 2018. New home construction has climbed 7.8 percent year-to-date. But builders also face cost pressures from a lack of available land and construction workers, as well as from higher commodity prices from the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. EUROPE-GOOGLE-ANDROID EU fines Google a record $5 billion over mobile system BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union fined Google a record $5 billion Wednesday for using the market dominance of its Android mobile operating system to force handset makers to install Google apps, reducing choice for consumers. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google went against EU rules when it required mobile phone producers to pre-install the Google Search and browser apps as a condition for licensing Google's app store. She said Google also paid big producers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app. Vestager said that ""companies must compete on their merits,"" playing by antitrust rules that favor consumers and open markets, and not restrict competition. Google said it would appeal. ""Android has created more choice for everyone, not less,"" said company spokesman Al Verney. The EU's fine is the biggest ever imposed on a company for anticompetitive behavior. EUROPE-STEEL EU tries to limit influx of steel diverted by US tariffs BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union has announced measures to shield its market from a glut of steel heading to the continent after the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of the metal. The Trump administration put tariffs this year on steel and aluminum from several countries, including the 28 of the EU. The EU now fears that steel from around the world that would have gone to the U.S. will be diverted to the EU, swamping its market. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said that ""we are left with no other choice than to introduce provisional safeguard measures to protect our domestic industry against a surge of imports."" Under the measures, the EU will impose tariffs of 25 percent on 23 categories of products if imports exceed a 3-year average. TRADE-URANIUM-INVESTIGATION US launches national security probe into uranium imports WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department has started an investigation into the impact of uranium imports on U.S. national security, a move that could result in tariffs and add another front to the Trump administration's trade fight. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the United States produces just 5 percent of the uranium needed for the U.S. military and for electricity generation, down from nearly half in 1987. Two U.S. uranium mining companies, UR-Energy and Energy Fuels, requested the investigation in January. The probe follows an earlier national security investigation into steel and aluminum imports, which resulted in steep 25 percent duties on imports of the two metals from the European Union, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. A second investigation focused on the threat to security posed by auto imports is ongoing. ZIONS BANCORP-FINANCIAL THREAT TAG Regulators seek end to stricter oversight of Zions Bancorp WASHINGTON (AP) — A panel of federal regulators is proposing the removal of strict government oversight imposed on Zions Bancorp after the big regional bank received a taxpayer-funded bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The unanimous decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Wednesday is the latest example of a push, under the Trump administration, to dismantle rules put into place after the financial meltdown in hopes of averting a similar crisis in the future. A final action on the Salt Lake City bank is likely within 60 days. The council was empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to collar some large financial companies with stricter supervision as a way to avert a ""too-big-to-fail"" situation — when the government is forced rescue them to head off a broader economic collapse. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY-BUYBACKS Berkshire Hathaway stock jumps after buyback rules eased OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is up 4 percent after easing restrictions on buying back its own shares. The Omaha, Nebraska, conglomerate led by Warren Buffett said Tuesday that after it posts earnings on Aug. 3, it will begin allowing Buffett to buy stock at prices up to the shares' intrinsic value. Since 2012, Berkshire has restricted buybacks to prices below 120 percent of the stock's book value, which is an estimate of the company's value after liabilities are subtracted from assets. Given the company's massive cash pile (Berkshire has hoarded more than $100 billion while Buffett looks for another acquisition or investment) the rule change ups the odds that it will be directed at buybacks. It will not do so if it would reduce its cash below $20 billion.

Powell, the first non-economist to head the Fed in nearly four decades, says his goal is to speak so that he can be understood not just by economists and Wall Street investors but also by the typical household. He noted that he has already announced he will double the number of press conference he holds each year from four to eight — one after every Fed meeting starting next year.

1363,"DETROIT (AP) — Japanese air bag maker Takata is recalling an additional 3.3 million faulty air bag inflators as it expands the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. The latest recalls cover frontal air bags in certain 2009, 2010 and 2013 vehicles made Honda, Toyota, Audi, BMW, Daimler Vans, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Tesla. Automakers will provide specific models in paperwork that will be filed later this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Notices of the expanded recalls were posted Saturday . Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 20 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection. The recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority. Many automakers have been slow to replace the potentially deadly inflators. A report by an independent monitor said that as of Sept. 15, 2017, automakers have recalled 43.1 million inflators. Of those, only 18.5 million, or 43 percent, have been replaced even though Takata recalls began in 2001. NHTSA has said the Takata recalls are unprecedented in size and complexity and have resulted in groundbreaking lessons that will help automakers reach their repair goals. The agency said it is monitoring the automakers' progress and working to expand best practices to boost completion rates. The agency also has the authority to fine automakers that don't make recall repairs in a timely manner.",406,410,Auto Brand,688

1391,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — In the future Nissan envisions, driverless cars will pick up children from school and recommend restaurants to tourists in various languages. Nissan Motor Co. says feedback from people who try it will be used to fine-tune its ""robo-vehicle mobility service."" The automaker said Friday that 300 people have already signed up to try out Easy Ride next month. The Japanese automaker hopes to roll it out as a commercial service in the early 2020s. Details, including pricing, are undecided. The service was developed in a partnership, which began last year, with Japanese mobile game provider DeNA Co. DeNA has been working on driverless bus and delivery services in Japan. For now, Easy Ride will be limited to a 4.5-kilometer (2.8-mile) course that starts from Nissan headquarters and winds through a shopping mall area in this port city. The app is only in Japanese, but there are plans to offer it in several languages for tourists and other travelers. Like other autonomous drive technology, the Easy Ride vehicle is packed with cameras, sensors and radars to recognize pedestrians, intersections, traffic lights and other vehicles. It's still only driverless in principle, though, since Japanese law doesn't allow totally driverless vehicles. So a human driver in a no-hands position sits behind the steering wheel. The system isn't flawless, with human intervention sometimes needed to avoid a crash, according to Nissan. It's just one of several such kinds of technology being worked on around the world, such as Google's Waymo and Tesla's Autopilot. Just about all the major automakers, including Mercedes and Toyota, are working on such technologies. Nissan has been among the most aggressive. Although opinion is divided on the projection that as many as 10 million driverless cars will be on roads by 2020, everyone agrees the technology is going to grow. ""I think the potential is quite large in the long term, especially in large cities such as Tokyo or Boston, where there is a need for point-to-point transit but little incentive to own cars,"" said Nicholas Evans, an assistant professor at UMass Lowell. However, he cautioned, ""In introducing technology, all it takes is for a couple of high-profile accidents for consumers to turn against manufacturers. ""It's in the self-interest of manufacturers for rigorous testing and public input on this new kind of technology,"" said Evans, who studies the ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies such as drones and self-driving vehicles. Ogi Redzic, senior vice president for the alliance among Nissan, Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said Easy Ride's technology will deliver safer rides because most accidents are caused by human error. Redzic, who oversees the alliance's connected vehicles and mobility services, sees fail-proof cybersecurity as crucial. Driverless mobility services could also help make up for growing labor shortages, reduce traffic and parking problems and help energize depopulated areas, Redzic told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a news conference Friday announcing the service. For Easy Ride, users first download a special app on their cellphones. After logging on, voice recognition is used to set a destination, and the date and time for when the ride picks you up at one of four possible spots in Yokohama. A display visible from the vehicle's back seat shows its route on a digital map. It also recommends events such as concerts, historical landmarks, restaurants and other places to visit, which pop up as photos and text on the display. The service also includes coupons that can be downloaded and used at those spots. Some glitches remain. In a recent demonstration, the app had trouble launching because of a poor internet connection at Nissan headquarters. When a reporter said, ""I want to eat a burger,"" it successfully recommended several nearby joints. But it was not able to find the nearest New Balance store, or any other place to buy sneakers. ____ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama",1560,1564,Auto Brand,692

1404,"DETROIT (AP) — Long emergency stopping distances, difficult-to-use controls and a harsh ride stopped Tesla's Model 3 electric car from getting a recommended buy rating from Consumer Reports. While the magazine said the car has exhilarating acceleration and handling, testers were troubled by its 152-foot average stopping distance from 60 miles per hour in emergency braking tests. The magazine said the distance was worse than any modern car it has tested, and is about 7 feet longer than a Ford F-150, a full-size pickup truck that weighs about twice as much as a Model 3. Tesla said in a statement that its own tests found 60-to-zero braking distances averaging 133 feet. It says stopping distances are affected by road surface, weather, tire temperature, brake conditioning and other factors. It also says it continually does software updates to improve factors such as stopping distance. The Model 3 is Tesla's first attempt to appeal to mass-market buyers. The car that starts at $35,000 but can run as high as $78,000 has been plagued by production delays. Consumer Reports said it tested the car at its track on pavement monitored for consistent surface friction, using industry standard test procedures. The car was tested with the same 18-inch Michelin tires that were used in Tesla's test, the magazine said. On the first Consumer Reports test, the Model 3 stopped in about 130 feet, similar to Tesla's findings, according to the magazine. But testers could not repeat that distance even after letting the brakes cool overnight, it said. Because of the inconsistency, the testers borrowed a second Model 3 and got results similar to longer distances in testing the first one. The Tesla's stopping distance was 21 feet longer than the class average for luxury compact sedans, the magazine said. Jake Fisher, director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, said the first test shows him that the Model 3 has the mechanical ability to stop in 130 feet and that a software change may bring consistently shorter stopping distances. If that happens, Consumer Reports would re-evaluate the car, he said. Consumer Reports also said that Car and Driver magazine experienced inconsistent and sometimes long stopping distances when it tested a Model 3, including one stop from 70 mph that took 196 feet. Although it doesn't happen often, Consumer Reports in the past has decided not to recommend vehicles based largely on long braking distances. Last year the magazine decided not to recommend the Hyundai Ioniq gas-electric hybrid car because of below-average braking. It took the car 144 feet to fully stop from 60 mph on dry pavement. The magazine also said nearly all of the Model 3's controls are on a center touch screen direction with no gauges on the dashboard and few buttons inside the car. This forces drivers to take several steps to do simple tasks and can cause driver distraction, the magazine said. The car also had a stiff ride and excessive wind noise at highway speeds, unlike competitors, Consumer Reports said. Consumer Reports also said it got a record 350 miles of range per charge with a long-range version of the Model 3 when it's set on a high mode to recharge batteries with energy from braking. The magazine said it took delivery of the Model 3 that it purchased on Feb. 8, and it was the latest model available at the time. Consumer Reports recommends Tesla's Model S, ranking it No. 1 in the ultra-luxury car category. But its other model currently on sale, the Model X SUV, is not recommended due to low reliability.",101,105,Auto Brand,694

1458,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators have released models from 14 different automakers that are being recalled to replace potentially deadly Takata air bag inflators. Documents posted Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration include many made by Ford, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Daimler Vans, Toyota, Tesla, BMW, Fiat  Chrysler, Mazda, Subaru, Jaguar-Land Rover, McLaren and Volkswagen. , and released some of their models last week. Earlier this month Takata faulty air bag inflators as it expanded the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. Models released Thursday are equipped with those inflators. The company uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers. At least 21 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured. The U.S. recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority. Some of the recalls are limited to certain groups of states. To see if your vehicle is involved, go to https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls and key in your 17-digit vehicle identification number. It can be found on your registration and is stamped on the driver's side dashboard. Automakers and the government say the recall repairs should be done as soon as possible. The latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles.

1465,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Co. said Thursday it will begin selling its first self-driving vehicles by 2021 in partnership with U.S. based self-driving technology startup Aurora Innovation Inc. Within in three years, Hyundai and Aurora will bring autonomous vehicles to markets that can operate without human input in most conditions, the company said in a statement. The auto industry designates that as ""level 4 autonomous driving,"" just one stage short of fully autonomous driving. The partnership has yet to say how its first batch of self-driving vehicles will be used, but analysts expect they likely be for commercial use, such as self-driving taxis or ride-hailing services, rather than for sales to individual consumers. General Motors said in November that its self-driving vehicles will carry passengers and deliver goods in big cities by 2019. Aurora was founded by a former chief technology officer at Google's self-driving car unit, a former Tesla Autopilot director and a former self-driving engineer at Uber. Hyundai has been pursuing partnerships to keep pace with changes in an industry that is being transformed by artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and other cutting edge-technologies. It earlier joined with Cisco Systems Inc. and Baidu Inc. to collaborate on internet-connected cars.

TRUMP-EPA Trump offers support to embattled EPA head WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is offering his support to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency who is at the center of swirling ethics questions. Two administration officials confirmed that the president called Scott Pruitt on Monday and told him that ""we've got your back."" Trump urged Pruitt to ""keep his head up"" and said the White House supported him. The officials said White House chief of staff John Kelly reiterated those sentiments in a call to Pruitt Tuesday morning. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations. Pruitt has come under intense scrutiny for his use of a Capitol Hill condominium linked to a prominent Washington lobbyist whose firm represents fossil fuel companies. GENERAL-MOTORS-SALES-REPORTS GM to halt monthly sales reports and switch to quarters DETROIT (AP) — General Motors says it will stop reporting its sales figures every month and instead will post the numbers each quarter. The move could prompt other automakers to make the same change. Currently nearly all U.S. automakers report sales monthly. GM says 30 days isn't long enough to separate real trends from short-term fluctuations caused by weather, new product launches or other factors. The company's sales are down 3.2 percent so far this year when the rest of the market is down just under 1 percent. Its sales fell 1.4 percent last year. The company has been reducing low-profit sales to rental car companies. Many automakers use those sales to boost monthly numbers. GM says it will report March sales Tuesday with other automakers, then switch to quarters. TESLA-SALES Tesla raises production but falls short of Model 3 goals DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Inc. increased production of its Model 3 mass-market car in the first quarter but still fell far short of the numbers it promised last summer. The Palo Alto, California, company says it made just under 9,800 Model 3s from January through March. That's four times what it made in the fourth quarter. But it's still only a fraction of the 20,000 per month that CEO Elon Musk promised when the car first went into production. Tesla's shares rose nearly 5 percent to $264.82 in early trading Tuesday. Tesla says it made just under 35,000 vehicles in the quarter including the Models S and X. That's a 40 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. The company says it addressed Model 3 production and parts supply bottlenecks. JAPAN-TOSHIBA Toshiba CEO promises turnaround in 5 years, beefed up ethics TOKYO (AP) — An outsider tapped to lead scandal-tarnished Japanese electronics company Toshiba Corp. is promising a turnaround in five years by reshaping its operations. Nobuaki Kurumatani, the first outsider to be appointed chief executive at Toshiba in more than half a century, acknowledged corporate governance had been weak. He told reporters Tuesday at Toshiba's Tokyo headquarters that he brought his experience in the financial sector, where compliance controls are tougher. Toshiba has been embroiled in an accounting scandal involving the massive doctoring of books. It also racked up heavy losses in its nuclear business and is selling its lucrative computer-chip business to avoid going belly-up. At the center of the losses is the acquisition of CB&I Stone & Webster by its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year. FACEBOOK PRIVACY SCANDAL-USER POLL Facebook asks users if they think it's 'good for the world' NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is asking users whether they think it's ""good for the world"" in a poll sent to an unspecified number of people. The latest poll appears under the heading, ""We'd like to do better,"" when users log in. Possible responses range from ""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree."" Facebook regularly polls users on its service. The latest comes as the company grapples with a privacy scandal and other troubles . Facebook did not immediately respond for comment CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to ensure that Facebook is a force for good in the world.

GRINDR-HIV-STATUS Gay dating app Grindr to stop sharing HIV status NEW YORK (AP) — The gay dating app Grindr will stop sharing its users' HIV status with analytics companies. Chief security officer Bryce Case told BuzzFeed News on Monday it decided to stop sharing information with Localytics to allay people's fears. Localytics and Apptimize were paid to test and monitor how the app is used. The company says the firms are under ""strict contractual terms that provide for the highest level of confidentiality."" Grindr says data that may include location or information from HIV status fields are ""always transmitted securely with encryption."" Grindr says it's important to remember it is a public forum and users have the option to post information about their HIV status and date when last tested.

SUPPLEMENT-SALMONELLA RECALL FDA orders recall of salmonella-tainted herbal supplement WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health authorities are ordering a Las Vegas company to pull its herbal supplements off the market because some of its products tested positive for salmonella, part of a nationwide outbreak linked to the ingredient kratom. The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it took the rare step of ordering the recall because Triangle Pharmanaturals refused to cooperate with regulators. Companies typically issue their own recalls of tainted products. Various brands of kratom supplements have been linked to nearly 90 cases of salmonella across 35 states, according to federal figures. Sold in various capsules and powders, kratom has gained popularity in the U.S. as an alternative treatment for pain, anxiety and drug dependence. The FDA says the ingredient is dangerous and has no approved medical use. WATER PARK FATALITY-CHARGES Agents arrest designer of Kansas water slide that killed boy DALLAS (AP) — Federal authorities in Dallas have arrested one of the designers of a Kansas water park slide that decapitated a 10-year-old boy. Trent Touchstone, chief deputy with the U.S. Marshals Service in Dallas, said Tuesday that 72-year-old John Timothy Schooley was met by agents at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport late Monday. Schooley will be held in Dallas pending his arraignment and extradition to Kansas on charges that include second-degree murder. A Kansas grand jury last week indicted Schooley and Jeffrey Henry, a co-owner of Texas-based Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts. The indictment alleges Schooley lacked technical or engineering expertise in amusement park rides. Caleb Schwab died on the 17-story Verruckt ride in 2016 when the raft he was riding went airborne and hit an overhead loop.

1528,"FINANCIAL MARKETS Dow trades above 25,000 points NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average has been trading above 25,000 points today for the first time, just five weeks since its first close above 24,000. Technology companies, which put up some of the biggest gains in the last year, continued to outpace the rest of the market Thursday. Banks were benefiting from higher bond yields, which allow them to charge higher interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans. Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo posted solid gains in midday trading. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.48 percent. MORTGAGE RATES Average 30-year mortgage rates slip to 3.95 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates fell this week, making it slightly more affordable to borrow for a home. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slipped to 3.95 percent from 3.99 percent last week. The average has tumbled from 4.20 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 3.38 percent from 3.44 percent in the prior week. This same rate average 3.44 percent last year. The interest charged on U.S. Treasury notes dropped from a week ago, causing mortgage rates to slip in response. The average on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages slipped to 3.45 percent from 3.47 percent last week. ADP Survey: US businesses add a strong 250,000 jobs in December WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. companies closed out 2017 with strong hiring in December, adding the most jobs in nine months. Payroll processor ADP says that businesses added 250,000 jobs last month, up from 185,000 in November. The gains were led by robust hiring in health care, professional services such as accounting and engineering, and retail. The figures suggest that businesses are optimistic about the economic outlook and are staffing up to meet greater demand. ADP's data bodes well for the government's monthly jobs report, to be released Friday. Economists forecast that will show a gain of 189,000 jobs, according to a survey by data provider FactSet. The unemployment rate is projected to remain at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. MACY'S-OUTLOOK Macy's saw growth for the holidays NEW YORK (AP) — Macy's says it enjoyed sales growth during the holiday season, but the improvement wasn't enough to offset a tough year. The department store said Thursday sales at established stores rose 1 percent in the November-December period. It now expects that figure to decline between 2.4 percent and 2.7 percent for the year. Total revenue is forecast to decline 3.6 percent to 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier. Macy's also says it will close another 11 stores early this year, cut jobs and streamline non-store functions. That should produce savings of about $300 million. Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 3.4 percent for the nine-week period ended Dec. 30. The holiday sales growth is encouraging for department stores, which are struggling to reinvent themselves. INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES New health insurance rule aims to deliver on Trump promise WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is proposing regulations to facilitate the interstate sale of health insurance policies that cost less but may not cover as much. But it's not immediately clear whether the new proposal from the Labor Department will fulfill President Donald Trump's long-standing promise to promote competition across the country. The rule would make it easier for groups — or associations — to sponsor health plans that don't have to meet all consumer protection and benefit requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Those requirements improve coverage, but they also raise premiums. Insurers are skeptical of Trump's idea. Patient groups are concerned about losing protections. And some state regulators object to federal interference. There's another wrinkle: Health insurance, like real estate, reflects local costs, which vary widely. BRAZIL-FACEBOOK-FALSE NEWS Facebook to combat false news in Brazil ahead of election SAO PAULO (AP) — Facebook is announcing initiatives in Brazil to counter false news reports that are expected to proliferate as the country heads toward October elections. The social media giant says one of the projects is a free online course designed for teens, young adults and educators on how to spot and contain the spread of false stories. It will also create a Messenger bot that will tip users on online information. The initiatives are to be in place by June, when Brazil's presidential campaign is set to accelerate. Claudia Gurfinkel is Facebook's head of news partnerships for Latin America. She said Thursday in a statement that the initiatives are the result of discussions with academics, news literacy experts, fact-checking agencies and journalism associations. PUERTO RICO-CORRUPTION New Puerto Rico law targets graft, shields whistleblowers SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico's governor has signed a new law aimed at fighting corruption in the U.S. territory amid a deep economic crisis. The measure bars judges from granting probation to anyone accused of corruption, obstruction of justice or any other charge that involves public funds. People convicted of graft are prohibited from running for elected office. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Thursday that the law also strengthens protections for whistleblowers and increases the statute of limitations for those seeking to file a civil complaint for alleged reprisals. The government can seek triple the amount of compensation in a civil claim for any case involving misuse of public money that results in a conviction.

Airports in the New York City area and Boston have been particularly hard hit, with more than two-thirds of flights in and out canceled.

The companies on Thursday announced partnerships with Aurora Innovation, started last year by ex-Google autonomous car chief Chris Urmson and others. VW says its collaboration will help bring self-driving cars quickly to roads worldwide, while autonomous Hyundais are expected to be in the market by 2021. The partnerships are the latest in a string of tie-ups between traditional auto companies and tech firms as they race to be first with self-driving vehicles. Aurora is based in Pittsburgh and Palo Alto, California. It was started last year by Urmson, former Tesla executive Sterling Anderson, and ex-Uber autonomous vehicle leader Drew Bagnell.

PRODUCTIVITY US productivity grows at tepid 0.7 percent rate in Q1 WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. productivity grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, a weak reading but a slight improvement from the previous quarter. The Labor Department says that the first quarter increase followed an even weaker 0.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter of last year. Labor costs rose at a 2.7 percent rate in the first quarter, the fastest gain in a year. Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, is a key factor determining how fast the economy can grow and how much living standards can increase. Productivity gains have been lackluster for most of this recovery, increasing just 1.3 percent for all of 2017. Economists are uncertain why productivity has been so tepid. ECONOMY-SERVICES US services firms grew in April at slowest pace this year WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. services firms grew at a slower pace in April compared to the prior month, as companies are reporting cost pressures from possible tariffs and a shortage of available workers. The Institute for Supply Management says its services index fell to 56.8, from 58.8 in March. This marks to lowest reading of the index this year. Still, any reading above 50 is a sign of expansion. The services sector has been expanding for the past 99 months, or more than eight years. The index is drawn from a survey of purchasing managers in the services industry, which includes finance, health care and retail and accounts for the majority of U.S. economic activity. The employment and production components of the index decreased in April, although both pointed to continued growth. TRADE GAP Record exports cut US trade deficit to $49 billion WASHINGTON (AP) — Record exports trimmed the U.S. trade deficit in March for the first time in seven months. The Commerce Department says the trade gap slid to $49 billion, down from $57.7 billion in February and lowest since September. Exports rose in March to a record $208.5 billion, led by shipments of civilian aircraft and soybeans. Imports slipped 1.8 percent to $257.5 billion. President Donald Trump has vowed to bring down America's massive deficits, which he blames on bad trade agreements and abusive practices by U.S. trading partners. Top administration officials are visiting Beijing this week for talks aimed at reducing America's huge trade deficit in goods with China, which fell 11.6 percent in March to $25.9 billion. So far this year, the trade gap is up 18.5 percent to $163.4 billion. MORTGAGE-RATES US key mortgage rate declines slightly to 4.55 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — The key long-term U.S. mortgage rate declined slightly this week, after a steady rise for most of April that pushed the rate to its highest level in more than four years. With the spring buying season underway, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages slipped to 4.55 percent from 4.58 percent last week. By contrast, the benchmark rate averaged 4.02 percent a year ago. The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate loans ticked up to 4.03 percent from 4.02 percent last week. REVEAL-REDLINING-BERKSHIRE-HATHAWAY Buffett's mortgage companies found to cater to white clients UNDATED (AP) — Mortgages lenders controlled by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway are making the vast majority of their home loans to white borrowers in a way that former prosecutors say may violate the Fair Housing Act, a 50-year-old law that banned racial discrimination in lending. That's according to a new exposé by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. The non-profit newsroom examined the records of three lenders under Berkshire Hathaway's corporate umbrella. It found the companies -- HomeServices Lending, Prosperity Home Mortgage, and Trident Mortgage Corporation --- employed overwhelmingly white teams of loan officers, placed their offices in white neighborhoods, and concentrated their lending in white neighborhoods. Among their biggest markets are Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC, where a majority of residents are people of color. TRADER-FRAUD CASE Appeals court reverses conviction of ex-Wall Street trader NEW YORK (AP) — An appeals court in New York says a former Wall Street trader can be released from prison because he was improperly convicted of taking advantage of a government bailout program. The ruling Thursday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals frees Jesse Litvak from a two-year prison sentence he was serving after his securities fraud conviction last year. Authorities say he was the first person convicted of a crime related to the program that used bailout funds in the financial meltdown to restart trading markets for mortgage-backed securities. It is the second time the appeals court has reversed a conviction of Litvak since he was indicted in 2013. The 2nd Circuit earlier reversed his conviction on charges of securities fraud, Troubled Asset Relief Program fraud and making false statements.

1536,SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Wall Street Journal is reporting that government regulators have subpoenaed Tesla as they dig deeper into CEO Elon Musk's recent disclosure about a potential buyout of the electric car maker. The subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission demands information from each of Tesla's nine directors. The Journal cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter. Fox Business News was the first to report the SEC's action. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment Wednesday. The SEC opened an inquiry shortly after Musk surprised investors with an August 7 tweet revealing that he lined up the financing to buy all the Tesla stock from shareholders willing to sell. The subpoena signals regulators have now opened a formal investigation into whether Musk was telling the truth in his tweet.,101,105,Auto Brand,621
1537,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla is recalling 123,000 sedans worldwide to fix a problem with the power-assisted steering. The recall covers all Model S sedans built before April of 2016. Five bolts holding the power steering motor in place can corrode and either come loose or break, possibly causing a loss of power steering. Manual steering would still work. Tesla says the problem happens infrequently in places where salt is used to clear snow and ice from roads. It's recalling all the cars even in warm-weather states just in case. No crashes or injuries have been reported. Service centers will replace the bolts with ones that are more corrosion-resistant. Owners will be notified Thursday by email.

1540,"BEIJING (AP) — Electric car producer Tesla will build its first factory outside the United States in Shanghai, becoming the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Tesla Inc.'s announcement comes amid mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and follows Beijing's April promise to end restrictions that required foreign automakers to work through local partners. Tesla said construction would begin in the near future, once official permits are obtained. It said production would begin two to three years after that and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. No financial details of the agreement signed Tuesday were announced. A city government statement said the factory would be the biggest foreign investment to date in Shanghai, a base for joint ventures between General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG and a state-owned automaker. The signing ceremony was attended by Tesla chairman Elon Musk, Mayor Ying Yong and other Chinese officials, according to the city government. China is the world's biggest electric vehicle market but Tesla and other producers including GM and Nissan Motor Co. had been reluctant to transfer manufacturing to this country due to the requirement to share technology with Chinese partners that might become rivals. Tesla began selling cars in China in 2014, shipping them from its California factory, which added a 15 percent import duty to the price. Despite that, China quickly became its No. 2 market after the United States. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market,"" the company said in a statement. Tesla is among companies hit by additional 25 percent import duties imposed by Beijing in retaliation for a tariff hike by U.S. President Trump in a dispute over technology policy. ""The tariffs may have accelerated their plans for sure, but longer term they need a presence in the largest auto market globally,"" said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne. Tesla has discussed opening a factory in China since at least 2016. ""Still need to see how it gets paid for, which has been a concern,"" Osborne added. Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into developing electric car models for China. GM, Ford Motor Co., VW, Nissan and other competitors have announced ventures with local automakers to develop models for China's lower-income market. Sales of pure-electric passenger vehicles in China rose 82 percent last year to 468,000, according to an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000. Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology. Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas. Later, they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually. Also Tuesday, Germany's BMW AG announced a partnership with China's biggest SUV maker, Great Wall Motor, to produce electric versions of its MINI cars. Tesla said it also would set up a research and development facility in Shanghai. The company said the China factory would not affect production in the United States, which is forecast to increase. Tesla announced last year it was talking to the Shanghai city government about possibly building a factory. The plan went ahead after Beijing said in April it would end limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. Industry analysts said that the ruling Communist Party believes its own producers such as BYD Auto are close to being able to compete with global brands in performance and price. Ownership restrictions on other parts of the auto industry are to end by 2022, the government said. The city government statement said local authorities will ""strongly support"" Tesla as part of efforts to develop Shanghai as a center for electric research and production. ___ AP Business Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.",37,41,Auto Brand,707

1549,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and Chinese governments have been flashing a lot of bravado just before firing the first shots in a conflict that risks erupting into a mutually damaging trade war. ""China will not bow in the face of threats and blackmail, nor will it be shaken in its resolve to defend global free trade,"" a spokesman for Beijing's Commerce Ministry declared Thursday, one day before the two sides were to subject billions of dollars of each other's goods to punishing tariffs. President Donald Trump, who ran for the White House on a vow to force China and other nations to reform their policies, has insisted that a trade war would be easy to win. Yet among the people and business in both countries that are suddenly under threat from higher costs, closed-off markets and deep uncertainties, there's far less confidence. A trade war between the world's two biggest economies will leave casualties — from makers of musical instruments to farmers in America's Midwest to a manufacturer of soldering irons south of Shanghai. In some areas and industries, pain is already being felt. ""There's going to be an awful lot of battles lost on the way,"" said Tim Velde, a fourth-generation farmer in western Minnesota's Yellow Medicine County who is bracing for  China's tariffs on American soybeans. ""I don't see anybody winning."" Tong Feibing, general manager of China's Ningbo Top East Technology Co., which makes soldering irons and had been exporting 30 percent of its output to the United States — before sales plunged in advance of tariffs — is worried. ""There is a chance the company will lose money and might bankrupt,"" Tong warned. ""I will do whatever I can, including layoffs."" At 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Friday, the United States was set to slap tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese products. And Beijing was ready to respond in kind. From there, the hostilities could escalate quickly and drastically. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on up to $450 billion in Chinese imports — nearly 90 percent of all goods China sent the U.S. last year — if Beijing continues to retaliate and doesn't yield to Trump's demands. The Trump administration wants China to drop what it calls its predatory drive to supplant American technological dominance, through tactics that include forcing U.S. companies to reveal trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market and committing cyber-theft. Trade wars can draw blood in several ways. Exporters face taxes on what they ship across the Pacific. This makes their products more expensive and less competitive. And importers must pay more for the foreign machinery and components they buy — and then decide whether they can afford to pass along those higher costs to their customers. In choosing the Chinese goods to tax, the Trump administration tried to limit the impact on American consumers. It aimed instead mainly at industrial products. Yet those tariffs will hurt American companies that rely on Chinese-made components and machinery. Most Americans wouldn't recognize the vast majority of the Chinese imports that the Trump administration is targeting. But they would recognize the companies that use them. PetSmart, for example, says the administration's tariffs will inflate the cost of imported water filters for home aquariums. Jacuzzi has said its hot tubs and bathtubs will be affected by higher U.S. tariffs on pumps. Newell Brands, which owns Rubbermaid, says Americans may face higher costs for its imported FoodSaver vacuum sealer products, which are used to store and preserve food. Moog Music Inc. in Asheville, North Carolina, known for synthesizers used by the likes of David Bowie and Michael Jackson, warns that the tariffs on imported Chinese circuit boards and other parts will ""immediately and drastically"" increase the cost of its instruments and might require layoffs. In a worst-case scenario, Moog said, it might have to move some manufacturing overseas. It's urging employees to call their congressional representatives to protest the tariffs. In southern China, a company that makes LED-lighting is scrambling to find alternatives to the U.S. market, which used to buy 30 percent of its output. The company's salespeople have looked instead for buyers from Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, according to company manager Yang Zhuangnin. He said the company, based near Hong Kong, will try to make improvements to draw American buyers despite higher prices. ""Another method we have been thinking about is to send almost-finished products to another country, and then do the simple production there and re-export to the United States,"" Yang said. ""Clients may have other ways and suggestions. We'll see."" In selecting American products for retaliatory tariffs, Beijing chose many that would inflict political as well as economic pain. Its target list is heavy on American farm exports — a shot at Trump supporters in the nation's heartland. Farmers are also well-represented by lobbyists and powerful members of Congress who might be able to influence the Trump administration. Don Bloss, who grows corn, soybeans, sorghum and what on 3,5000 acres of rolling land in southeastern Nebraska, says the tariff threat has already driven down crop prices. ""Right now,"" Bloss said, ""it's a matter of how much money you're going to lose, not how much money you're going to make."" Automakers could endure pain, too, once China applies higher tariffs to vehicles from the United States. Beijing already imposes a 25 percent tariff on imported autos. Retaliatory tariffs would likely double that tax, said Kristen Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. That could mean trouble for BMW, Mercedes, Tesla and Ford, the largest exporters of vehicles from the U.S. to China. All would likely raise prices, which would slow sales and could force production cuts. A result could be layoffs, Dziczek said, especially at a BMW SUV factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, and a Mercedes SUV plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In addition, the SUVs those plants make include parts from overseas that would be subject to increased U.S. tariffs, further raising prices, she said. Trump's trade team insists that the United States wields a decisive edge over China in a trade war: China sells much more to America ($524 billion last year) than Americans sell China ($188 billion) and so is more vulnerable to tariffs. But trade analysts are skeptical that Beijing will blink first.  The question, said Philip Levy of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, is which side has more political tolerance for pain. ""From China's perspective, this is an unacceptable foreign assault that they will resist at all costs,"" said Levy, who was a trade adviser in President George W. Bush's White House. ""From the perspective of U.S. businesses and farms, this is a self-inflicted wound. That will lead to mounting pressure on members of Congress, which does retain the power to do something about it."" ___ Associated Press Writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis; David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Tom Krisher in Detroit; Christopher Bodeen and Joe McDonald and AP researcher Fu Ting in Beijing contributed to this report.",5714,5718,Auto Brand,708

1572,"BEIJING (AP) — President Xi Jinping set the stage Tuesday for a possible effort to resolve a worsening clash with Washington over technology and trade by promising to cut auto import taxes, improve intellectual property protection and boost imports. Xi's pledges at a business conference came as China filed a World Trade Organization challenge over one aspect of its sprawling conflict with President Donald Trump — last month's U.S. tariff hike on steel and aluminum. Strains over U.S. complaints that China is flooding global markets with unfairly low-priced goods and pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology have spiraled into the biggest trade conflict since World War II. Speaking to Chinese and foreign businesspeople, Xi didn't mention Trump or their dispute. He pledged progress on areas that are U.S. priorities including opening China's banking industry but gave no direct response to Trump's demands such as ending requirements for foreign companies to work through joint ventures that require them to give technology to potential Chinese competitors. Private sector analysts saw Xi's speech as an overture to help resolve the standoff that has fueled fears the global economy may suffer a setback if other governments raise their own import barriers. Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods worth $50 billion. Beijing fired back with its own $50 billion list of U.S. goods for possible retaliation. In his speech, Xi tried to position China as a defender of free trade, despite its status as the most-closed major economy, in response to Trump's ""America first"" calls for import restrictions and trade deals that are more favorable to the United States. The speech was free of the nationalist bluster that increasingly marks Chinese official statements and repeatedly called for international cooperation. ""China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open wider,"" said Xi at the Boao Forum for Asia. Xi, the country's most dominant leader since at least the 1980s, said Beijing will ""significantly lower"" tariffs on auto imports this year and ease restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry ""as soon as possible."" He also promised to encourage ""normal technological exchange"" and to ""protect the lawful ownership rights of foreign enterprises."" ""President Xi's speech could create a very good platform to launch U.S.-China dialogue at the WTO to find a deal on intellectual property rights,"" said economist Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit in a report. ""This would be a victory for the world trading system and an important step away from the abyss of rising global protectionism."" The dispute is likely to end ""with a concession from China,"" said Larry Hu of Macquarie Group in a report. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also speaking in Boao, welcomed Xi's promises. ""We look forward to seeing these strategies elaborated, implemented and bearing fruit,"" Lee said, according to a transcript issued by his office. Meanwhile, Chinese diplomats filed a request at WTO headquarters in Geneva for consultations with Washington over Trump's tariff hike on steel and aluminum. If that fails, Beijing can ask for a ruling from a WTO panel of experts. China also has issued a $3 billion list of U.S. goods including pork and apples for possible retaliation. Chinese officials deny foreign companies are compelled to hand over technology, but business groups say joint venture and licensing rules make that unavoidable. Last month, the United States filed a WTO complaint accusing Beijing of violating its trade pledges by imposing unfair contract terms and allowing companies to use foreign-owned technology after licensing periods expire. Foreign companies complain Beijing is squeezing them out of promising parts of the state-dominated economy to promote the ruling Communist Party's plans to create Chinese global competitors in fields including robotics, electric cars and pharmaceuticals. Xi gave no details on how those conditions might change, leaving it unclear whether that might mollify Washington. Easing rules that limit the foreign stake in an auto joint venture to 50 percent might help to address Trump's complaints about technology as well as giving them more flexibility in their biggest global market. Jake Parker, the vice president for China of the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group, welcomed Xi's announcement but expressed hope for additional steps such as ending requirements for joint ventures and technology licensing. ""Ultimately, U.S. industry will be looking for implementation of long-stalled economic reforms, but actions to date have greatly undermined the optimism of the U.S. business community,"" said Parker in an email. Xi repeated earlier official pledges to open China's finance industries to foreign investors but gave no additional details. The biggest beneficiaries of a cut in China's 25 percent tariff on most auto imports will be the handful of automakers such as electric car brand Tesla that have no factory in China. Other automakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen that assemble vehicles in China with local state-owned partners could offer additional models. More broadly, Xi repeated official promises to expand imports and to narrow China's trade surplus, which reached $423 billion last year — about two-thirds of that with the United States. ""China does not seek a trade surplus,"" said Xi in comments that were broadcast on national television. ""We have a genuine desire to increase imports and achieve a greater balance of international payments."" The bulk of Xi's 40-minute speech was devoted to China's vision for economic development and its global role following a ruling party congress in October that installed him for a second five-year term as leader. Xi tried to defuse concern about Beijing's growing military might and territorial disputes with its neighbors, saying his government wants to pursue peaceful, cooperative development. ""We will not bully our neighbors,"" the president said. ""Cold war thinking and zero-sum games are increasingly obsolete.""",5005,5009,Auto Brand,709

TESLA Tesla CEO's buyout bid raises eyebrows, legal concerns SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking relief from the pressures of running a publicly held company with a $72 billion buyout of the electric car maker, but he may be acquiring new headaches with his peculiar handling of the proposed deal. Almost everything about the deal is outlandish, from Musk's out-of-the-blue disclosure in a nine-word tweet to the assertion that he has lined up adequate financing to a buy a company that seems to burn through cash faster than it produces cars. If Musk can pull it off, he will have burnished his reputation as an eccentric visionary who has been compared to Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy depicted by actor Robert Downey Jr. in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But if the buyout flops, Musk and Tesla will likely face class-action lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were duped, and potential legal trouble from the Securities and Exchange Commission, too. The SEC already has opened an inquiry into the wording and method of Musk's disclosure about the deal, according to a Wednesday report in The Wall Street Journal , which cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. IMMIGRATION-BUSINESSES TARGETED Immigration raids in Nebraska, Minnesota target businesses OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A large federal law enforcement operation conducted Wednesday targeted businesses in Nebraska and Minnesota that officials say knowingly hired — and mistreated — immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. The investigative arm of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement — Homeland Security Investigations — led the operation that saw about a dozen businesses and plants raided and 17 business owners and managers indicted for fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Of those, 14 were taken into custody Wednesday and three were still being sought. Authorities also arrested more than 130 workers at various businesses, busing them to Grand Island, Nebraska, to be questioned and processed. Most of the arrests occurred in northern Nebraska and southern Minnesota. Several of the businesses were in O'Neill, Nebraska, a town of about 3,000 about 160 miles (260 kilometers) northwest of Omaha. Officials said they were still looking to take three owners or managers into custody as part of the operation. CONGRESSMAN-STOCK INDICTMENT GOP congressman from New York charged with insider trading NEW YORK (AP) — Republican U.S. Rep. Christopher Collins of New York was arrested Wednesday on charges he fed inside information he gleaned from sitting on the board of a biotechnology corporation to his son, helping family and friends dodge hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses when one of the company's drugs failed in a medical trial. Collins, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who was among the first sitting members of Congress to endorse his candidacy for the White House, pleaded not guilty to an indictment unsealed at a court in Manhattan. The indictment charges Collins, his son and the father of the son's fiancee with conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements to the FBI. Speaking to reporters in Buffalo hours after his release on bail, Collins, 68, professed his innocence and said he would remain on the ballot for re-election this fall. Prosecutors said the charges stem from Collins' decision to share with his son insider information about Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., a biotechnology company headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices in Auckland, New Zealand. Collins was the company's largest shareholder, with nearly 17 percent of its shares, and sat on its board. CALIFORNIA GAS LEAK Huge Los Angeles gas leak leads to $120 million settlement LOS ANGELES (AP) — Officials say a Southern California utility reached a nearly $120 million settlement over a massive blowout at a natural gas storage field that became the nation's largest known release of climate-changing methane and forced thousands to flee their Los Angeles homes almost three years ago. The settlement between Southern California Gas Co. and state and local governments aims to mitigate the greenhouse gases that spewed uncontrollably for nearly four months. The October 2015 blowout at an Aliso Canyon well sickened residents of the San Fernando Valley and led to evacuations of 8,000 homes. Under the settlement, the utility agreed to pay up to $25 million for a study of long-term health consequences; reimburse city, county and state governments for responding to the blowout; monitor chemicals in the air along the boundary of the facility for eight years; and not pass costs of the settlement along to ratepayers. Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the tentative deal, which will be open to public comment and requires court approval, addressed violations of health and safety codes, the illegal discharge of air contaminants and failure to report the release of hazardous materials. TAXI TURMOIL NYC moves to rein in Uber with cap on ride-hail vehicles NEW YORK (AP) — New York City moved Wednesday to regulate the explosive growth of Uber and other app-based ride services with a temporary cap on new licenses for ride-hailing services. The City Council approved a package of bills that included a one-year moratorium on new licenses for for-hire vehicles while the city studies the rapidly changing industry. The legislation also will allow the city to set a minimum wage for app-based drivers. Backers of the proposals said both the traditional yellow cab industry and drivers for app-based services are suffering as Uber cars flood the city's streets. They said the growth of ride-hailing apps has also worsened traffic congestion. Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said the councils' vote set a precedent for the world as companies like Uber and Lyft use technological innovation ""to return us to a time of sweated labor, destroying lives and livelihoods across the planet."" But Uber spokeswoman Alix Anfang said the pause on new vehicle licenses ""will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion.""
